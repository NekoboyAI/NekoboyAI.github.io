Email
=====

I can be contacted via email using the following addresses:

* `mfp19@` for IT matters.
* `mfp19@` for Weed&Beer matters.
* `mfp19@` for other matters.

Note: I've spent 20 of my 37 years advocating for bugs free IT tools and privacy.
After being investigated 3 times, and stalked, and ruined, I had to give up
my personal mail server and create my fake identity (see 'Public conversations').
As a result I don't have an email address.
I'm Defective by Design.

Note on confidentiality
-----------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party
Mail Service Provider. The IT Guys who work at the provider are (technically-wise)
able to read all my incoming and outgoing mail.
And are (technically-wise) able to filter out and write an email using my name.
And they even stopped to wear "I read your mail" t-shirts:
public authorities and company policies took over the good guys.

This is by definition of how email infrastructure work, 
and it is irrelevant whether SSL or other encryption is used 
between email clients and corresponding email servers.

Please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our emails (see [keys.md](/keys/) 
for info how to obtain and verify my GPG keys), on daily basis,
whether or not you have something to hide.

Note on integrity of my emails
------------------------------

All email sent by me from the above-mentioned email addresses should be
digitally signed with my email [keys](/keys/).

A notable exception are mailing lists. Some majordomos rewrite parts of the messages by
adding info on how to unsubscribe from a given ML. That, unfortunately, breaks
any attached digital signatures to the messages, of course.
The whole "breaking the things" started when Microsoft pushed MIME multipart extension to
accomodate the marketing department needs, relying on channel security
enforced by PPTP. Geniuses. But it is a long and pretty tricky story.

Once a nice chinese guy told me "QQ is Microsoft" but I had no
idea of what he was speaking about: all I knew from european medias
was that QQ was a popular instant messaging app in China; 
and their culture is one of the most cryptic to my eyes 
and the eyes of all my ancestors. It's pretty hard to communicate properly.
So: "MIME multipart is Microsoft". That's it.


Phone, Skype, etc.
==================

I don't believe phone (or similar means of communication) are that great for
technical discussions. In most cases discussions are clearer, faster, 
and more comfortable using email!
Asymmetric tools give you time to think twice and work according to
your timing and schedules instead of someone else's ones.

Moreover Skype does not offer any meaningful security or privacy and 
I have no illusions that other global PSTN or cellular telephony does
offer it either.

Skype is a closed communication system based on 
[proprietary protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_protocol)
that forces the audio streams into the supernodes. And those supernodes,
all of them, are managed by a single central administration.
And the same occurs on most public phone networks, since ever.
Nowadays every conversation that doesn't occur in a bunker, 
using a language customised in pairs, is public.
We should be discouraging businesses and governments from forcing us into
closed centralised systems.
And bring skype back to the first network model where the supernodes were
crowdelected according to computational resources available.

And to tell you the truth, I haven't got a clue on stream ciphering
machine-discretised audio payloads. I've never been stuying it in detail.
I have doubts about the strenght of a system that first sample, then encrypt,
finally transmit on a sessionless/stateless protocol.
The ZRTP/SRTP/SRCTP looked good enough to me for end-to-end securing my calls 
but I've never been experimenting enough to being able to asses its security.

That being said, my pupped identity is available
for scheduled public conversations.


Public conversations
====================

To engage with me in public conversations via 
my puppet identity (Michele Favara Pedarsi):

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Michelefavarapedarsi)
* [Gmail](mailto:michele.favarapedarsi@gmail.com)
* [Skype](skype:michele.favarapedarsi)

Notes on communicating with my puppet
-------------------------------------

* He is a late sleeper, and usually cannot do a phone call before 11.00 hrs of his local time.

* His personal tools (Personal Computer, Personal Smartphone, etc) are there for his needs, not yours.
If you don't get an answer don't take it personal.

* He can only read email in English, Italian, Spanish, French and Thai. But I won't be
writing to him in thai something more complex than "The pen is on the table".

* Please don't write asking him for advice about how to become a "hacker", or
"security researcher". He is a puppet only, he can't help you.

* He strongly prefers plaintext emails. He dropped the war against HTML-formatted messages
about 10 years ago. But I didn't: extra formatting is not welcomed.

* He disregards language control. If you want to talk to my puppet,
just be prepared to get a 'bullshit' here and a 'fuck off' there.

Further Note on Good Manners of my puppet
-----------------------------------------

Without offense, off course.

Long story short: I've plenty MiniMe around (fake profiles) and I can't keep saving money
to buy more mobile phones (and not taking care of my teeth, my beer, and so on).
In all this, language control is way too much.
Consider the 'bullshit' here and the 'fuck off' there as my foolish fingerprinting;
and use those fingerprints to filter out my pages on your side (only).
Don't worry, I won't get upset and I won't try to pierce your filter:
I don't need to sell you something.

The long story instead.

If you hear a Perfect Human on the other leg of the call instead, it's not me.
Start running away. Quick. Because I've no idea who is misleading you.
By not using those 'social tools' I've been able to nail down
fake Facebook, Whatsapp, Line, etc, profiles: 
some of my friends have been reading me, for years, 
on those social-something that I've never used.
I have no idea why someone could be willing to be me but ... 
I take it as a compliment, some sort of Unsolicited Digital Blowjob,
a gift; nobody can complain of a gift.
And carry on, keeping calm as much as possible. 
The biggest problem of this approach is that irony and sarcasm
are proper of ones' culture only, pretty hard to translate properly
(ie: without being offensive) to anyone.

Currently I'm trying to register as many popular social-crap as I can to lock my ID
into my terminal, but it took a while for the industry to lower the costs of terminals
down to my ridicolous budget. Finally GOVs-baked trojans, evil maids, 
and the whole Public Sekurity business, turned the whole existance into a 
very psychedelic game. Obliging me to change terminals to change [all those
IDs that entangle any and avery device nowadays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip).
It's a game that I can't afford but ... I hope it will settle down one day.
There should be something like "medical mariuana exception" for all of us
that can't live with all this crap in our working tools: "medical DRM exception".

And of course, it's pretty hard to catch up with all those Beebo-Frengu-Bubu-Cookuh 
'social business projects' popping up everyday, 
burning money in so-kind-so-cute Communication Assholes' hands, since 10 years ago.
They are too many. They keep abusing of personal data, call it 'business', 
and call themselves Ernest. Marketing was already an insult big enough, 
without Social Networks. Today is an assault: I don't have time
to fill in all those forms for services I don't need, don't want, I'll never use,
and shouldn't exist for an overall Pretty Good Privacy!!!
Moreover, the more social services I register, the wider the attack surface is.
It's a loosy game.

"Heal the Woooooorld, make it a better plaaaaace, for you and for me and
the entire human race, there are people dying ... "

As a result, I've my terminal RAM constantly clogged by Apps
that I don't use and, after Ed Snowden, even some Privacy Apps
implementing a colorful and shining [Security Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater),
pretty funny for my foolish puppet, deadly scary for _myself.
Plus crappy 'smartphone boosters' that recover my RAM, 
turn bells and whistles on and off ... everything pre-installed 
for my courtesy. Making other people happy, making me crazy instead.
And Google/Ubuntu Phone SDKs don't help much; they include in the SDK 
a bootloader that isn't: it is the payload of another bootloader
that in turn, comes together with the bare metal.
One bare metal supervisor for each silicon producer.

Garbage collection have always been a problem.

And today it is even hard to genuinely be a nice person.
And we have to live with it. Fuck off, then :)
