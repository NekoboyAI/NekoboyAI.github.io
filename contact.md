Email
======

I can be contacted via email using the following addresses:

* `mfp19@` for IT matters.
* `mfp19@` for Weed&Beer matters.
* `mfp19@` for other matters.

Note: I've spent 20 of my 35 years advocating for bugs free IT tools and privacy.
After being investigated 3 times, and stalked, and ruined, I had to give up
my personal mail server and create my fake identity (see 'Public conversations').
As a result I don't have an email address.
I'm Defective by Design.

Note on confidentiality
------------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party
Mail Service Provider. The stuff who work at the provider is (technically-wise)
able to read all my incoming and outgoing mail. This is by definition of how
email infrastructure work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or other encryption
is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. 
Please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our communication (see [keys.md](/keys/) 
for info how to obtain and verify my GPG keys), whether or not you have 
something to hide.

Note on integrity of my emails
-------------------------------

All email sent by me from the above-mentioned email addresses should be
digitally signed with my email [keys](/keys/).

A notable exception are mailing lists. Some majordomos rewrite parts of the messages by
adding info on how to unsubscribe from a given ML. That, unfortunately, breaks
any attached digital signatures to the messages, of course.


Other notes on emailing me
--------------------------

* I get lots of emails. This means I might not find time to respond to your
email. In some cases, although rarely, I might not read through the whole
message. Please understand that I would also like to have life outside of my
email VM...

* I can only read email in English, Italian, Spanish, French and ... well ... 
Thai, but it takes me 1 day to translate 1 page, please don't :)

* Please don't write asking me for advise about how to become a "hacker", or
"security researcher".

* I strongly prefer plaintext emails. If you send me an HTML-formatted message I
will still be viewing it as plaintext, and so I might be missing on some of the
extra information you put there, such as markings done with differently colored
fonts, etc.


Phone, Skype, etc.
===================

I don't believe phone (or similar means of communication) are that great for
technical discussions. My experience shows that phone-based conversations lack
technical depth, and are prone to misunderstandings, especially pronounced when
talking over VoIP connection across the oceans. Additionally, they require
fixed time slots allocations, suitable for both parties, which is generally a
PITA. In most cases discussions are clearer, faster, and more comfortable using
email! Not to mention they could be much more secure if GPG is used also.

That being said, I'm available for scheduled phone or conference calls. 
I'm a late sleeper, and usually cannot do a phone call before 1100 hrs of my local time.


Note on Skype
-------------

As a matter of principle I don't use Skype. Skype does not offer any meaningful 
security or privacy and I have no illusions that other global PSTN or cellular telephony does
not offer it either.

Moreover Skype is a closed communication system 
based on [proprietary protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_protocol).
We should be discouraging businesses and governments from forcing us into
closed systems. Imagine a road system that allowed only one select make of cars
to be driven -- would that be fun?


Public conversations
====================

It is also possible to engage with me in public conversations via my puppet identity:

* [Gmail](mailto:michele.favarapedarsi@gmail.com)
* [Skype](skype:michele.favarapedarsi)

Note: I disregard language control. So, if you want to talk to my puppet,
just be prepared to get a 'bullshit' here and a 'fuck off' there.
Without offense, off course.


Policy on LinkedIn
==================

I don't use LinkedIn. I my account exists for couriosity sake only. The
stream of invites from total strangers, inability to verify trust,
some wierd community work under the hoods, all makes
LinkedIn and similar platforms rather meaningless, and mildly dangerous.

Please do not send me LinkedIn or similar invites. These will be reported as
spam.
