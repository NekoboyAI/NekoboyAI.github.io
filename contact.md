Email
=====

I can be contacted via email using the following addresses:

* `mfp19@` for IT matters.
* `mfp19@` for Weed&Beer matters.
* `mfp19@` for other matters.

Note: I've spent 20 of my 37 years advocating for bugs free IT tools and privacy.
After being investigated 3 times, and stalked, and ruined, I had to give up
my personal mail server and create my fake identity (see 'Public conversations').
As a result I don't have an email address.
I'm Defective by Design.

Note on confidentiality
-----------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party
Mail Service Provider. The stuff who work at the provider is (technically-wise)
able to read all my incoming and outgoing mail. This is by definition of how
email infrastructure work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or other encryption
is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. 
Please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our communication (see [keys.md](/keys/) 
for info how to obtain and verify my GPG keys), whether or not you have 
something to hide.


Note on integrity of my emails
------------------------------

All email sent by me from the above-mentioned email addresses should be
digitally signed with my email [keys](/keys/).

A notable exception are mailing lists. Some majordomos rewrite parts of the messages by
adding info on how to unsubscribe from a given ML. That, unfortunately, breaks
any attached digital signatures to the messages, of course.


Other notes on emailing me
--------------------------

* I get lots of emails. This means I might not find time to respond to your
email. In some cases, although rarely, I might not read through the whole
message. Please understand that I would also like to have life outside of my
email VM...

* I can only read email in English, Italian, Spanish, French and ... well ... 
Thai, but it takes me 1 day to translate 1 page, please don't :)

* Please don't write asking me for advise about how to become a "hacker", or
"security researcher".

* I strongly prefer plaintext emails. If you send me an HTML-formatted message I
will still be viewing it as plaintext, and so I might be missing on some of the
extra information you put there, such as markings done with differently colored
fonts, etc.


Phone, Skype, etc.
==================

I don't believe phone (or similar means of communication) are that great for
technical discussions. In most cases discussions are clearer, faster, and more comfortable 
using email!

Skype does not offer any meaningful security or privacy and 
I have no illusions that other global PSTN or cellular telephony does
offer it either.

Skype is a closed communication system based on 
[proprietary protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_protocol)
that forces the audio streams into the supernodes. And those supernodes,
all of them, are managed by a single central administration.
And the same occurs on most public phone networks, since ever.
We should be discouraging businesses and governments from forcing us into
closed centralised systems.

Nowadays every conversation that doesn't occur in a bunker, 
using a pairs-customised language, is public.

That being said, my pupped identity is available for scheduled public conversations. 
I'm a late sleeper, and usually cannot do a phone call before 1100 hrs of my local time.


Public conversations
====================

To engage with me in public conversations via 
my puppet identity (Michele Favara Pedarsi):

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Michelefavarapedarsi)
* [Gmail](mailto:michele.favarapedarsi@gmail.com)
* [Skype](skype:michele.favarapedarsi)

Note: I disregard language control. So, if you want to talk to my puppet,
just be prepared to get a 'bullshit' here and a 'fuck off' there.
Without offense, off course. Because I've been able to track fake Facebook,
Whatsapp, Line, etc, profiles. I have no idea why someone could be willing to be me but ...
... I take it as a compliment and carry on.
The biggest problem of this approach is that irony and sarcasm
are dungerous as well, nowadays.
