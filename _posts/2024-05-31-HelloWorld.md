Filen Drive gets 50GB of storage quickly
Quick introduction: Filen Drive comes from Germany (Germany is a good place to upload R18 content with a bit of openness)
The platform is a cloud platform that provides "private" storage of data, using end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge encryption.Each user can get 50GB of space directly (unlike some companies Onedrive, Google, Mega, Dropbox, Icolud without any encryption or privacy, and will delete users' porn files directly)
The content begins:
You need three preparation tools
1. Google Chrome No Trace mode
2. Fake Email https://temp-mail.io/zh
3. Invite link (purpose for extra 10 gb) https://filen.io/r/1f71fb4468c7c85b24910ccbb10e5ef7
Sign up with My connection to get an extra 10gb (base users give away 10gb, so that's 20GB)
