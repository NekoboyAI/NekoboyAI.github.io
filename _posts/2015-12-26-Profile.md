Lovely. Now let's try figure out why is not, yet. We, IT Guys, togheter with a bunch of fools. As usual. 

### <a name="justdoit"></a>Just do it

I hate (many things but also) this sentence

Because we, IT Guys, are already doing IT. You can see a runner falling, you can see a fighter winning, you can see Shia LaBeouf screaming ... but you can't see us doing it. Anything. 

Well, you can see someone's fingers flying over a keyboard that doesn't even produce music; with today's touch technology, not even ear mechanical clicks any more; but many can't distinguish a bank's frontdesk officer entrying data, from Q managing the GCHQ supercomputer

Nor distinguish a washing machine from a computer. It's an [old problem](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/tv-typewriters.html) that we tried to address in time, in many different ways with varying results, some historical examples

* [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)
* [Blinkenlights](http://blinkenlights.net/blinkenlights)
* [Intelexit](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/drone-flies-over-nsa-complex-in-germany-dropping-pamphlets/) 

We can't do much against commercial powers like Casio ("digital clock"), Paramount ("tricorder") and Apple ("iPhone"). Nobody ever liked the word "computer". Except us. Even people that has been using computer since ever, [made the Silicon Valley's marketing department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Rackham), and are amused and positive about computers (but not enough for investing on us), don't understand what the hell we do: that's me with one of the Silicon Valley marketing gurus

And we can't do anything against the militaries! They tend to be deadly: the most impressive historical result of mixing Consultative selling and Motivational buying. Those poor guys are our brothers separated at birth. [They are Schwarzenegger, we are De Vito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twins_%281988_film%29).

Given that there's no "hacker university" nor professor, I got the Hacker Bachelor Degree in 2008 by hackers clapping at MOKA2008, for "Sapere Aude 1784 - Episode 0" video (about CCC2007). A small summer camp for IT Guys. The rest of the world was ignoring us and giving for granted their shiny Macbook-powered iInternet. Until they realised that it was failing. 

The Master in 2009 by medics, lawyers and psycologists laughing. 

The cops searching my house and seizing my equipment in april 2010, for me, have been my PhD: the only and most efficient way to both access the judicial system and by doing so, (contribute to) changing a bunch of laws at once; maybe even to trigger what is called 'constitutional exception' in the italian jurisdiction and is capable to invalidate the whole single act (and more than one). The highest of the civil challenges. For free. Theoretically.

In practice they did anything they could, up to 2014 in the Italian Embassy in Bangkok, to not process my case. Today Italian Police advice adults, teenagers, and parents ... to stay anonymous. I and I, win.

I feel the United Nations in all its departments (WIPO, FAO, IMF, WB, etc) as a very far, overlapping, unconsistent, expensive thing that ... fails. Something that is not mine. Probably the only foundamental branch of it is the Security Council; and it has been considered malformed for many years. And I haven't seen blue helmets - Interposition, god bless you guys - on the news since 1997 (Jugoslavia). 

Similarly the European Union. And the Italian Banana Republic is not much different: when I saw [Laura Boldrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Boldrini) - ex: UNHCR's spokesperson... SPOKESPERSON... ANOTHER MARKETING SUCKER - appointed President of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy in 2013, I've felt the world crumbling. Again. I consider marketing people being sick, psychos. This is me learning marketing from the book "Jesus cleans better" (than Dixan)

But I'm happy that finally, after all the major disasters mankind have been facing in the last 15 years, [UN](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/167), the [EU Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20151022IPR98818/Mass-surveillance-EU-citizens'-rights-still-in-danger-says-Parliament), the [EU Court of Justice](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150117en.pdf), have found a few minutes for privacy. Rights have always been recognised at large, only after a fail have been so big that was impossible to not recognise it. 

And law, in general, can't preceed reality without being an hammer instead of a shield. But in Italy, despite the EU claims of "world human rights defenders" [it was not working](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html). Unless we invent the time machine; then the cause-effect principle can be inverted. 

The financial system also can invert many things; and it actually does it, everyday, in every household of the globe. In the italian legal system any not criminal offence (and the civil part of a criminal one) can be financially inverted. But ... [that's another story](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/20/Timeless.html).

### <a name="2010"></a>2010

I didn't trigger on purpose; I was debugging my environment since I declared myself stateless and suggested a Constitutional review process, in 2008. The ones you've seen on the news in the while is just bullshit. 

On 23 of January 2010 I knew I could easily trigger a red flag, but the allegation I was going to trigger would have been just one more of the unconstitutional laws to interrupt. And one more detail of a bigger problem: the obsolescence of the institutions and the fail of the current information systems. Four years later the italian constitutional court (sentence 01/2014) just confirmed it ... 

My ex-girlfriend (and her law professor) the 3rd of April triggered the cops, so on 12th of April it was my D-Day; I got 4 cops in my place: "holy crap, I must switch to [DEFCON3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON)! What the hell... !#@$!@#!#@!". So I asked two lawyers for help; they both have been very kind and by appointing one, I avoided public defenders 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/USkEzLuzmZ4">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Public Defenders (HBO)</iframe>

USA is not Italy, but the results are the same. The worst thing is that ... we can't even defend ourselves in person, it must be trough a lawyer. In US, as far as I know, the judge may grant this setup on request. We, italians, must accept the risk that the lawyer introduces his coscience, his party, his politics, his mistakes in asserting the security of his communication tools... whatever ... and guess what: 4 years later my (forced) lawyer (via skype; no ID confirm) left my case claiming ethical incompatibilities between me and him. Ambulance chaser. 

In the 6 months following the search&seize I went a few times to the courthouse: after 1 month to have my case's papers, then another month later to deposit a dissequester request, noticing irregular judicial procedures. Scared because there was some off-side-track manipulation, 4 months later (without any news) I went to the courthouse again to get my laptop back or at least to know that my request was registered, then I mobilized the airforce (ie: got a cheap charlie charter flight for cheap charlie tourists) and switched to DEFCON2 leaving my lawyer behind: "Fuck them, in 6 months I can't even have my computer back; how long do I have to stop living?" 

That's me in the americas mimicking [Colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_%22Hannibal%22_Smith)&[Faceman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templeton_Peck)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFG3NViwQ4M">MFP Hannibal Sberla</iframe>

"Sberla" is the name given to Faceman in the italian version of the A-Team; it means "slap" because of the italian idiom "slapface" ("to be cheeky"). 

### <a name="2011"></a>2011-2012

I was (and I am) scared but those cops might have been my [Pengiun Liberation Front](http://plf.zarb.org/): my heroes! Because finally, after many years trying to access the judicial system, I had myself nailed and locked in a court. Wunderbar!!! 

> "It is the duty of the Republic to remove those obstacles of an economic or
social nature which constrain the freedom and equality of citizens, [...]"
> ( Italian Constitution, art. 3, comma 2 )

Court members, by being public officers, have the duty to report any 'fumus commissi delicti' (ie: suspect of crimes): by asserting crimes in a court session, you can trigger a whole bunch of parallel trials that you haven't been able to trigger youself (by lack of will, interest, money, attorney, or whatever). 

In my case I didn't want to directly target a judge (of another civil case that I was not involved in), nor the law professor of my girlfriend: both are too big for me. "GOV vs Mario" never works; and the italian version of the american 'class action' is a fairy tale. But doing it by proxy: "GOV vs GOV", "Queen vs Queen", "[Kramer vs Kramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramer_vs._Kramer)" ... it sounds better, does it? 

So this is me dancing naked to celebrate my PhD

and I agree, but ... hey girls: [I'm a Free laugh](http://creativecommons.org/), [Jim wasn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright), don't complain! 

And this is me (poorly) reading Shakespeare to celebrate my PhD

Again, the best part is not me, but the piece of marble under my ass that is not talking: it's a piece of an original altar of Roman era. 

And this is me closing my hard times between CCC2007 and CCC2011, the handover to the next generation of rebels

Bells Beach, Australia, 2011. [Point Break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Break). 

### <a name="2012"></a>2012 - 2014

At the beginning of 2012 I gave up also with Partito Pirata (the italian chapter of the Pirate Party); an unconsistent group of wankers I was speaking to trough a backoffice manipulated email. In february 2012 I downloaded my email from Gmail using POP3 instead of reading it trough the web panel and ... my emails were stored as "Michele Pedarsi", but the ones I was looking at on the web panel were correctly reported as "Michele Favara Pedarsi". Someone made a wrong [regexp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) ... go figure who I was speaking to, and where my face has been publish about! 
Since I left Italy it has been a continual struggle to set my box free

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/74OBuMA2qEk">Epic Drunken Fighting- Jackie Chan</iframe>

Aaanyway ... life goes on. So I've spent most of 2013 reading and yelling about Assange, Manning, Snowden and the italian judicial system. And I didn't give a fuck about the lawyer talking on Skype because he was refusing any voice call: no ID, no trust. 

Then finally, in 2014 I got the Aaron Swartz story on YouTube 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXr-2hwTk58">The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz (CC available)</iframe>

and fear rised again. Because the italian judicial system's fails 

* law: unconstitutional. 
* law enforcement: dumb. 
* procedures: fake. 
* prosecutors: laughing. 
* attorneys: useless. 
* judges: never seen. 
* constitutional court: unattended.

were perfectly described in that movie. So I start to dig a bit further in the american legal system to figure out how it comes that I got the same shit being in a completely different 'natural jurisdiction'. And to find some good american ideas that could be useful to fix the italian framework. Backtracking from time to time, and using the UK system to diff the american one. 

Many details popped up and suddenly a bigger picture was clear: UN spawned a whole bunch of departments mangling everything that goes from speech control ("hate speech", ie: censorship) to tourism (and, as an example, greying out new tourist developments from Google Earth); on top of continental departments (EU, US federal, etc); on top of nations; on top of regions; on top of provinces; on top of towns; on top of fractions. All top down. In my home town, I had 7 layers of bureaucrats plus banks, companies, etc, over my head and shoulders

> Technostructure ... the group of technicians within an enterprise (or an administrative body) with considerable influence and control on its economy. 
> ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technostructure )

That in turn sit on top of the landlords, shareholders, etc. At this point in time a bank should be a computer in a room, only, and me asserting integrity of the system to my clients (that own the money in the bank). The same applies for any public registry and voting machine. Since 2008 I refuse to serve whatever technostructure is more expensive than that: sorry, I can't steal money from the workers. 

Plus: how do I assert integrity of the machines if those machines are off-side-track manipulated from [the board's firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip), up to [the international BGP routes](http://www.zdnet.com/article/bgp-spoofing-why-nothing-on-the-internet-is-actually-secure/), and [whatever anybody does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team)? I can't lie to my clients. And to my self. Not on duty. Not for money. 

### <a name="2015"></a>2015

The adults were so busy in pursuing me that them - the kids - just did it: Bitcoin has been a masterpiece. And its reception a success: [if Wikipedia is correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country), all the countries have been very fair in its reception; even the limits (ex: China) and the prohibitions (ex: Ecuador and Russia) I've spotted are very ... I'd probably have done the same thing. 

Example: Ecuador denied the use of Bitcoin because in the middle of a dollarization process; by having the experience of my grandma during the euro transition, I agree with the Ecuador gov: it's just bad timing, they need more time to settle the ongoing process before opening a new one. 
And something similar appened in the other countries. Probably the most discouraging allowances were the ones from the most liberal markets, example: Australian government said "There’s no law against that, so we do have competing currencies"; that sounds like a special corpse private picking up a fight with a Red Cross medic while aliens are invading the Earth. 

I couldn't partecipate because of the strong propaganda in place and my digital tools heavily monitored, manipulated, etc. Even few weeks ago (september 2015) I start to talk about these things with a funny guy in a bar and suddenly he said: "Why did you get searched eh? Did you make DarkNets?". He's been brainwashed; I can't help him anymore. Darknet? Try to define 'darknet' to yourself, before talking about it with others. And he even asserted to be an IT security specialist!!! Eheh. Cisco Certified Lamerz. 3073. 

Now read again about all those news about [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) pedodrugs markets - ex: [Silkroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_%28marketplace%29) - and go figure whether they are real cases or not. Mission Impossible. 

In any case, it has been better for me to stay away from anything would look like money. And despite the fact I didn't get any (considerable volume of) money from anyone, I wonder why I keep getting my SSL sessions resetted everytime I try to access my bank account. I got, bank-to-bank only, just enough money to survive, from my family. But still ... I'm monitored. 

Last week I received a fake mail on my mobile phone during a conversation about the n-work-opportunity I got, and when I declared this off side track manipulation to my peer, the content of my gmail account changed (again) to remove the traces of the manipulation: email's headers before the disclosure contained more than one rcpt-to, after the disclosure one rcpt-to only. 

<a name="crime"></a>It's the Google bullshit, babe. The first email I wrote&sent from gmail to gmail (2003) was manipulated in the backoffice; the weird thing was that ... the manipulation was not a bad one: the content of the email was the same, but one of the adjectives I used had been changed with a better one; I used a popular idiom, slang, but the mail received on the other side was the formal version of it. Anyway ... enough to not use gmail and stay away from Google itself. 
I was lucky that the receiver was the one that invited me to the public beta of gmail, and he had his computer on the same desk of mine. Most of the people never had a chance to catch this subtle crimes. 

And I kept going like that as much as I could. Spending my life to get out from that shit. In vain. 

When the cops came to my house my friend I was sharing my mailserver with ... said he didn't want to get involved so ... I turned the server off and went hunting into the eagle's nest: today I have a gmail account and google+ waver. 

Even today, very few people are able to figure out that I'm not acting, nor fighting, just running, from nothing and everything

<a name="analprobe"></a>I'm sensitive to all those topics but honestly, all I want is a life without the Vatican University to profile me at 11 years old (Frascati, VillaSora, 1989). 
Nor a psyco-teacher asking me to fill in questionaries in an Australian school at 32 years old (Melbourne, Holmesglen, 2011). 
Or a girl checking - literally - my ass hole while I'm asleep for whatever reason I don't know about (Thailand, my room, 2012).

### <a name="today"></a> Today

[I'm tired to be manipulated by the italian militaries](http://www.bgpmon.net/how-hacking-team-helped-italian-special-operations-group-with-bgp-routing-hijack/), and for them to hide behind 'the hackers': I'm an Hacker and I've never stolen a Bit, nor a Coin. Fuck off. 

I want the same thing of 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and today: for my communications to be PRIVATE

> "Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of
communication is inviolable."
> ( Italian Constitution, art. 15, comma 1 )

And public money spent to enforce this. Not to enforce whitch haunts in order to being able to hijack more taxes. Plus: I'm still waiting to see my 'natural law' published 

> "A law is published immediately after promulgation"
> ( Italian Constitution, art. 73, comma 3 )

here. On this media. The Internet. Because it is faster in reaching a wider part of the public

> "By saying 'immediately after promulgation' the Constitution mandates the government, which is denied of any further decision, having only to choose the fastest way to publish the law"
> ( [163/1963 Const. Court](http://www.giurcost.org/decisioni/1963/0163s-63.html) )

They didn't know what '[integrity of a digitally encoded message](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/08/24/Integrity.html)' is, but the law publishing principle is still valid unless the Constitution is changed, by the people

> Sovereignty belongs to the people and is exercised by the people in the forms and within the limits of the Constitution. 
> ( Italian Constitution, art. 1, comma 2 )

Why this doesn't happen? Doesn't Just Happen? 

# <a name="behavioural"></a>Three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain

This general disability to understand what we do, makes any behavioural approach to us ending up between two philosophical concepts: ataraxia (ie: absence of movement) and apatheia (ie: absence of emotion). Dumb or perv. Dumb and perv. Dumb xor perv. Dumb not perv. Perv not dumb. 

Those, translated in contexts different from semiotics - ex: psycology, medicine, criminology, philosofy - easily become syndromes, deseases, personal offences, offences to the public order, and even minor and major crimes. Mileage varies according to local culture. This is me "Usual Suspect"

ehm... eat a [peperonata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew) for dinner and count how many days you won't be able to have regular sleeping patterns. I call my austria-born aunty from sicilly on purpose for this experiment: you'll get an original, genuine, scientific, math precision, sicilian made, german-spoken solidity, peperonata for you and the sake of our little experiment. And if you don't keep regular sleeping patterns in the next 3 days ... you must eat the metal and plastic parts of the server you published that bullshit on. The entire cabinet. Cooling liquids included. And the patch cord up to the patch panel (according to IEC standard; not ISO/OSI: it's longer). 

After figuring out that prohibiting to play with math is a bit... inverted - the teacher in Pink Floyd's video is making fun of the young boy for making poems and pushing him back to study math, not the opposite - UK Police [apparently removed](http://blog.quintarelli.it/2015/12/lerba-del-vicino-secondo-uk-da-ragazzo-esibivo-i-tratti-caratteristici-del-cybercriminale-in-erba.html) 

* Are they interested in coding? Do they have independent learning material on computing? 
* Do they use the full data allowance on the home broadband? 

And the Italian Police upped to the very top of all their pages the advice to parents, teenagers, and kids, to stay anonymous. They must have realised that it has always been pretty easy to motivate a kid toward arts and beauty; much more difficult to do the same toward math and engineering. We start to talk 1 second after we get out from our mothers but it takes a few years before we start to fight against the [Sorite's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox).

As I've learnt from other hackers "Paranoia is a Virtue", and I'm pretty sure that many officers need it daily for their investigations; it is where any hypotesis come from, and saves their butts in limit circumstances. It's a research tool. And an early warning trigger; expecially if you are the one supposed to not have fear (ie: the warning trigger for all the rest of us). But whenever they point at the Internet they are hammering the wrong nail. 

And let's not speak about "keeping someone busy": to do it since the childhood is the best way to produce a generation of natural born cocaine addicts. People that can't stay still 5 minutes without going mad. Unable to think, meditate, pray. People that after a car accident instead of waiting 7 seconds to calm down, look around, and check, before opening the door to meet the other side of the story... grab wrench and go straight forward to "have a little not-talk to the one that broken his car".

Imaginary ... bullshit. 

That's why the world could be, and it is not. 

At this point in time they should have discovered that the profiles machine-collected in the past 15 years are "fading away" as a result of the human being ability to learn from his own mistakes and make new ones. Our evolutionary attribute. 

I hope they stop profiling us as well.
