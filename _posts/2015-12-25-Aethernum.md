We had a [problem](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/08/24/Integrity.html), we have a [solution](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/15/Solution.html), we marched to [enforce human rights for all](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html), and we [fixed finance](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/20/Timeless.html).

Well, some sort of. Theoretical. 

# <a name="previous"></a> In the previous episodes...

At this point we have 

> tau = t * i
> 
> ether = euro * i

And ahead

> i = tau / t
> 
> i = ether / euro

So

> tau / t = ether / euro

Finally

> euro = (ether * t) / tau

And if you are producing shoes instead of imaginary products, it become

> euro = (ether * shoe) / tau

And if you are buying, instead of producing, it become

> euro = (ether * shoe) * tau

Where tau is your brain's time perception. A real scenario is a bit more complicate than that but nothing that our math guys can't crunch. Indeed, this is probably a very simple description of something that every manager does everyday to fill in his own only pockets; and as an overal picture, this is what the financial system does, since ever, in favor of different groups of people according to different kind of laws and contracts. Today, thanks to your 50 euros smartphone and ethereum, after a 'little' security review to remove factory embedded spies and rats, and a bit of training for yourself, you can do it too :) 

The importance of this theoretical excercise is to understand that we can adapt production times, production units, retail prices, wages, and everything, to the single individuals using a rational equation that granularly takes into consideration the single individual's [capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach) and [needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights). Example: Prof. Odlyzko talking about privacy, price discrimination, and the seeds of capitalism's destruction

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwHp3hh7O9Y">Odlyzko: The end of privacy and the seeds of capitalism's destruction - Chamber of Deputies, Italy</iframe>

In other words: this is a qualitative analysys only. To add numbers there's the need to hands on some more dark matter (ex: 80kg body mass in any efficient burner produces 0,2 Kw) and define tau accordingly. ACCORDINGLY. 

What I feel now is probably what [Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer) felt the night before the [Trinity Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_%28nuclear_test%29). 

Let's see now how we can import [Water-Vilfredo-LQFB-Bitcoin](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html) into Ethereum to make a coherent universal human rights continual production factory. 

* Water. Our bodies are made out of water already: nothing to import here unless you are a jellyfish. In other words, once the bottom line, the universal framework is in place, there's no way to get out of it because of the very inner nature of the blockchain system. 
* Vilfredo. Ethereum has a 'contract' feature. Every work team is created by signing a contract. And every contract 'bubbles' some results. By combining more than one working team you build up a new version of corporates, enterprises, guilds, clans, parliaments, etc. All inside the same blockchain. All nested inside the general basic contract. 
* LiquidFeedback. As I said, this tool was conceived as a feedback tool for representatives. By having a universe of Vilfredos confederated within a universal framework, the representatives become obsolete, and this tool can be used as a monitoring, reporting, archiving tool; and for scientific purposes.
* Bitcoin. In Ethereum they exist under the name 'Ether'. The main difference between the two is that the Bitcoin is an universal meter, the Ether is a universal meter blockchained to a contract.

Since 1999 (Seattle's No Global) the common issues were not the money, the jail system, the drugs, the pedos, the good, the bad, whatsoever. Those have always been, and being addressed. Everything, every "best practice", has always been arguable; but those problems have always been addressed, targeted, loved, destroyed. Both from authorities and the people in every street. 
The real common issue instead, was how to evolve our formal systems; in the case of the democratic institutions, it's about the parliament(s), the way we vote. And pay. 

But by talking about that we've been tagged [anarco-pedo-terro-satanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse). As usual. The modern hate for The Internet is just the same old hate that had given [fire to books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning).

Now look at the history of the UN Declaration of Human Rights; a not binding declaration. If you want a constitution start from there, or your own Nation one. And if you don't have/want one (ex: UK), it could be ok too: it's more dynamic. You just need to figure out how that system produce the same values expressed into the others high papers, and map them. 

In any case the UN declaration is a good starting point if you don't have a closer one; just don't start every time from the scratches you have around: that is exactly what happened before (Society of Nations) and after (United Nations) the Second World War; starting from the scratches is the best way to end up in ashes. And you&me in the ash tray. 
Everytime I see one of those youth forum for peace&love, as well as one of those xenofobic movements, my legs shake and my teeth rattle... for the same reason: people starting from the scratches. I guess there are some old aged clerics, monks, scientists, all around the world, silently laughing at us. The most beautiful thing of the Dalai Lama is his smile.

In 2010 I tought everything was lost. But when Edward Snowden popped up in 2013, I started to dream again. He made me think to the times, 20 years before, some italians were discussing the obfuscation of the last three digits of every telephone number, on our detailed (paper) phone bills. 
And much more: go digging in the italian Privacy Authority archive and you'll find my name on papers where I brought to court Telecom Italia and Alitalia for using my email address to send unsolicited commercial emails. I'm a privacy legionary. And Ed is my hero.

Edward Snowden produced a wonderful new wave of public discussion about privacy: 20 years before husbands and wives were worried about (not) being able to spy the telephone calls of their partners; today anybody (made a porn videochat) was worried about their dick-pics in the NSA datacenter ... same Idiocracy

But he triggered also some important changes in the formal systems. In US the Freedom Act reduced the application spectrum of the Patriot Act. In Italy something similar happened by limiting the amount of crimes that can trigger stealth wiretapping and access to the personal data backlog. And in many other countries [something similar happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Reaction)

Yesterday we, the Telephone Guys, were worried about the fact that the telephone network (circuit switching) is a nation wide machine that knows at any time how one telephone can reach any other telephone. It is its core business. 

Today we, the IT Guys, are worried about the fact that the data network (packet switching) is a world wide machine that knows at any time how one device can reach any other device. It is its core business. 

To stalk one and every networked device is the [core business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing) of any proactive network. To remove this you must use pure reactive networks. By using pure reactive networks, delays, convergence times, and many other network parameters increase to the point that ... many people could die for not having emergency teams in time. And it could take 5 minutes from inserting the telephone number to hearing the pizza guy on the other side. And for this reasons there's the need of [hybrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ad_hoc_routing_protocols). 

Yesterday, to have our meta-data (who called who) in our telephone bills was just an extension to the pool of people that can access our meta-data: not only the telco company and the cops, but the postmen too. And because the telephone network was a government controlled facility, that pool of people didn't grow much: by partially anonymising the callee-called numbers they protected our privacy from the fraudolent postmen.

Today things got way more complicate. But ... again ... by placing a "Not Sure Squad" at work, we have been able to crack the problem easy

and start a rebuilding process that already lead to some good results. Some temporary patches. 

# <a name="example"></a>Aethernum: an example.

A continent: Europe. De facto, geographically, Europe is very united; its politics just bullshit. All the planet is 'de facto very united' (and its politics just bullshit). Waters, deserts, mountains are 'naturally expensive to cross' as well. This is the reality that, willingly or not, shaped us all since ever. Start and restart always from there. All the rest is wishfull thinking. Unless we figure out how to make a teleport system, Newton and gravity keep kicking our ass. Plus, there's political bullshit coming from the past: Vatican City, San Marino, Monaco, Gibraltar, Ceuta, Melilla ... 

<a name="parliament"></a>A parliament: have you ever spent 5 minutes whatching a session of the British Parliament? Other parliaments look like an amphitheatre; semi-circular. The British parliament instead have two rows, opposing each other. The ones on one side send their champion in the middle, he talks with the back row chorus, facing the opponents ... on the other side, the same, alternating. In a very, very, disciplined way: practical. The greek-latin parliaments are 'proportional', the British one is 'bipolar'. The proportional ones work in Federations and Republics, the bipolar one works for Kingdoms. 
StarWars parliament instead, works for everyone: it is a sphere. We don't have electromagnetic levitation pods but ... Japanese could have a solution. In the while we can use what we have: cyberspace.

A constitution: one of the 2-3 important things I added to My Constitution was an automagical rule to increase/reduce the number of rules according to an index (ex: crimes). Try to apply that to the UN Declaration of the HR, and make it binding. I mean, drop any desire, wish, want, etc; start from 'need' only, meter it, and then go to the next rule, example: 

* Need: artt. 3, 25 (combined): "Everyone has the right to life [...] including food".
* Meter: 50 liters of water, 2500 kcal per day. 

Basically, by bind to such metered rule you've just built a bottom line where 'ether multiplied by t' or 'ether multiplied by shoe' results always in 'the right to survive' where 'survive' is defined as '50 liters of water, 2500 kcal, daily', mandatory minimum. 

# <a name="art"></a>Aethernum: previous art. 

In the previous chapter I made an example starting from water and food because of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). But in 2008 I started from 

> "Art. 1 - My Country is a democracy built on top of collaboration between anybody honour this text."

replacing the first article of the [Italian Constitution](http://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/costituzione_inglese.pdf) 

> "Art. 1 - Italy is a democratic Republic founded on labour."

The practical reason for adding an imaginary rule (ie: collaboration) on top of more empirical ones (ie: food) is that by keeping adding rules the late comers (ie: the new born) could find very little liberty in their lives, exspecially during downturns, and very little good teachers to explain them what they got at birth. 

> You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. 

And because any society can't apply 'tit for that' ('an eye for an eye...') as is. Human societies degenerate already as a result of millions of daily mistakes; it's just NORMAL. By creating punishments and penalties in a symmetric fashion, this degeneration runs faster. For this reason I consider the collaboration - not 'labour' - to be the highest duty for every human. 
By elevating 'labour' to the highest law instead, we have the need of a ladder, a gerarchy, etc, for any human activity; military procedures are continuosly imported into the civil society making it more expensive each time, creating incremental complexity and continual need of more expensive judicial systems in order to be able to address more complex symmetric wars. And having an authority that interrupts escalations become compulsory. 

> We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

To balance this high duty of collaboration that our kids have birth in, I introduced later in My Constitution a 'compulsory change declaration' to be done within the first 50 years of age, in order to be able to be considered an adult: being able to have a VAT number to open a company, being able to speak in public, being able to be a representative, being able to have a gun license for civil reasons, being able to have kids and educate them ... , without the need to be a military. 
[To produce and declare a solemn amendment to the current system you were born into](http://www.anythingtosay.com/) can be an alternative way to grant citizenship to people that can't/won't fight. Like me. In Italy the 'civil service' (alternative to compulsory military service) has been adopted in the mid '90ies. Some countries (ex: CH, IL) can't make it because of their demographic size and other reasons; but this general rule can be use concurrently to the military service as well. 

Millions of amendments dumped in a blockchain every year are a powerful evolutionary common system in the executive branch. The same that already happens in the judicial branch of the [common law systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law).

By elevating this high duty/right at constitutional level, anybody - Assange, Manning and Snowden included - would have one holy chance to make his own rebellion functional to build up a better world, at least once in life, without infringing any lower law, without the need of public expenditure for a judicial process, without the chance of censorship, and probably without risking their lives. 

Thousands of instances dropped in the public blockchain daily, that make the traditional representatives and the executives

simply obsolete. 

> Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

By me writing this text in Git (ie: a proto-blockchain), and you reading from it, you've just used a lightweight version of Ethereum to init a general contract that could serve as overall framework to any other future activity. 
[As far as I can understand Git itself lack of author and time signatures in its blocks](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/08/24/Integrity.html); this means that GitHub's [operators can manipulate authorship and publishing dates at will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConnectU#Mark_Zuckerberg). But for my purpose (ie: sharing the description of something that is not mine) is fair enough.
