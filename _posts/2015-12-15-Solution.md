It looks like someone DID IT! They solved the [integrity issue](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/08/24/Integrity.html) and much more.

While I was yelling at the moon, some little nasty invisible creatures in their secret basement were saving the world (again). 
IT Guys, incredible people; they took over the Santa Claus helpers lab. Those are the new toys that made me jump on my seat: 

* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) ([source](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs))
* [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) ([source](https://github.com/ethereum/))

The first one, IPFS, can (?) produce a permanent, robust, cheap, library, for every one. The second one, Ethereum, is "how the Internet was supposed to work": contracts, procedures, accounting, currency.

They could work like that:

* spend your 100 coins to buy a [4TB disk](http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-SATA-3-5-Inch-Desktop-ST4000DM000/dp/B00B99JU4S), 
* spend your 100 coins for an [RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [ODROID](http://www.hardkernel.com/), whatever tiny board is on stage at the moment... 
* spend your 100 coins for a case (or DIY), 
* spend your 100 coins per year to pay 24*365 electricity.
* partition that disk in 2 parts: private, public.
* map the public partition to an IPFS pool.

It may take a few years for you to save such little amount of money but ... still: minimum effort for a huge result. 
You can start with very little effort even if you are a nomad (ie: live on rent and alike) because 
it is easy to move that 20cm box around when you relocate yourself.

Et Voila': you are a founding honorary member of the first Distributed World Library. Projects like [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) could serve, togheter with other libraries, universities and even intelligence agencies, as an overall business continuity facility. Instead of sending money to projects like Wikipedia and Github, 
for profit or not, you could reduce their costs by having part of the pedia in your house, office, love cabin, car, jacket, pants and even in your bra.
Things like arxiv.org and jstor.org could share efforts on storage maintaining their own identity and best practices. 
Instead of having fear of loosing important pieces of human art, history, wisdom; some of those libraries could automatically acquire files that are loosing copies around the world to ensure enough redundancy. Making the knowledge tsunami, war, nuclear, resistant.

[Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) is smiling.

Now consider that IPFS is a complicate information technology thing "upon which one can build [...] blockchains"; 
and Ethereum is ... guess what? A blockchain. This means that whether you are a 
public administration seeking for a cheap&reliable IT solution, or a private business
seeking for a cheap&reliable IT solution, and you have already given yourself an IPFS box,
by adding Ethereum you can make your own private custom application, on top of a public
distributed filesystem, on top of your private digital locker under your bed close to your gun.
You might end up protecting Justin Timberlake's songs and some of my dick-pics as well, but ... like it or not, 
this way of keeping memories simply costs less than any commercial solution and it is more reliable.
And my dick-pics in your public part would be encrypted: you won't see anything.

Technology speaking, I didn't have chance to test it yet, to figure out what to use as underlying
filesystem (if any), its performances, and so on. And there's a lot to test here. Some examples: 

* Both are engineered to be distributed, and Ethereum claims to be "without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference". I spot some redundancy. Even more redundancy considering things like ZFS instead of EXT4 to comfortably grow the local box, or the need of DB applications (ex: Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, etc) to keep running current applications until the porting will be complete.
* Mixing multiple layered/nested encryptions allows to share a private Ethereum project on a public huge filesystem. But it doesn't necessarily produces a safer locker; it could be all the way the opposite.
* Modern devices, even cheap handhelds, have plenty parallel power to cope with all this fragments, retransmissions, encryption but are we sure that it is enough? And what about the buffer bloat problem? And what about garbage collection?

There are many other words rumbling in my poor brain at the moment (ex: plausible deniability). But we (me, you, anybody) don't need (almost) any fucking cloud service. Any more.

"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather."
(["A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html), [John Perry Barlow](https://homes.eff.org/~barlow/))

Et Voila': the full mankind's imagination stack could be soon something like a simple filesystem that exposes blocks
to an IPFS public planetary 'disk', on top of which Ethereum apps are build, updated, delivered, run.
All Free tech, all private, all shared. And all of human information is a pretty predictable electricity 
function to simply plan and schedule fair societies with.
Let's bootstrap it; if big datacenter companies will join us ... well ... the more the legacy formal systems 
(ex: government registries, Amazon EC2, Dropbox, etc) will crumble under their costs, and 
the more we would feel the need of creating "tax" accounts into our Ethereum private business projects, 
as well as "nsa" account into Ethereum private chats apps, to allow escrow and public funding on fair basis.

I know, considering what just happened (Assange, Manning, Snowden, and many other "unsung heroes") 
to feel the need to invite a spy at home may sound ridicolous but indeed ... it's already happening.
