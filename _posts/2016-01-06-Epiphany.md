there's the need of something that closes properly this [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesis_anarchism) before going back, in the next years, to incrementally clean up and expand the whole repository and turn it into a clear and comprehensible english lecture. 

Any time I get this feeling, my mind goes back to 1 hour spent with James Joyce's nephew in Dublin; he was having weekly lectures at Joyce's home to help young students in decoding the [Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29). I wish I had the chance to understand their language. When I left that place I had only one tought: "I didn't understand anything; but one day... oh yeah... one day... I'll read the Ulysses too, and it must be in english". And walked away with an undefined good feeling in my heart. Once back home I bought a copy of it, and I left it on my library for the right time; a time I would have had enough life to understand what the crazy old guy wrote at the end of his life. Another Mission Impossible. Life's too short.

# <a name="structure"></a>Structure.

A brief summary per each chapter. 

## <a name="test"></a>Sah sah sah ... Test. 

In this chapter the author - me - respect the tradition to say "Hi" in the most computer-fashioned way. It is a chapter a bit dry. Essential. Zen. 

The tradition predates back to the oscilloscopes tubes times, when ageing scientists used to get excited for turning a light on. A light that could be the detonation of the first nuclear bomb (without the feared chain reaction that could have burned the entire atmosphere), an hatch opening of the first lunar landing vehicle, or the statistical presence of the Higgs' Boson in a Large Hadron Collider made out of 9 nuclear power plants and an information system never seen elsewhere before. Lights that indicated respectively: survival, hope of future survival, chance to make that hope true. But normal people can't understand why a light can make navy officers and scientists excited. 

In this case we are observing a common case of post-C "Hi" transposed in a post-git and pre-bitcoin era. Did the author want to entirely skip Perl, ColdFusion, Java, PHP, Google, Facebook and RoR? (I'll wait the next 42-47 years for a a future archeologist to solve this dilemma, and a UIkipedian to stick a quote here in place of this sentence.) 

## <a name="integrity"></a>Integrity. 

> In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Integrity )

Findings: 

1. Without documents integrity there's no reason to produce documents: birth certificates, driving licences, diplomas, police reports, court orders, banknotes, property certificates. Think about one of those, one only, to change every time is handled to the next hop, so that one person see something, the next see something else, and so on, until the last one issue a death bounty truly convinced to have made a righterous sentence. Something so obvious that I feel shame to have abused of your time by using 3 lines of text. 

2. A very interesting case study is the [Laziogate scandal](http://unamericanaaroma.com/2012/07/23/to-rome-with-dignity/), that involved an italian politician [Francesco Storace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Storace); that in turn is just a small insignificant detail emerged from the ... explosion of the old italian internal agency SISMI: [SISMI and CIA kidnap a muslim imam in Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Omar_case), some kind of shortcircuit between black ops and judges prompted the [SISMI-Telecom scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISMI-Telecom_scandal) in which about 5000 VIP people, since 1996, were illegally surveilled. 
If you keep digging you'll find cops, military police (Carabinieri), financial police (Guardia di Finanza), etc, manipulating people in order to trigger the production of fake documents, up to 2007 reform of the agencies SISMI/SISDE into [AISE/AISI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenzia_Informazioni_e_Sicurezza_Esterna), the destruction of the files (instead of having public trials), and so on. To be fucking honest, the Vatican should have included that muslim guy in their christian saints calendars (if he wants to, it is a very high honour): San Antonio da Padova, San Daniele di Steccania, San Gennaro di Bisceglie, ..., San Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr. 
So don't dig it: as the american chick stated on her blog ([first link above](http://unamericanaaroma.com/2012/07/23/to-rome-with-dignity/)): "Usually I could care less about politics here in Italy. You’d need a freaking Ph.D. and then some to even touch the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand it all, anyways". I have that "freaking Ph.D." and my advice is to just take for good that the whole italian information system was broken: that's the only interesting point about "message integrity". And history repeating: after a new shower of scandals (MOSE, EXPO, MafiaCapitale), they just admitted (2015) the failure of the new extraordinary AISE/AISI system that followed the SISMI/SISDE ones: basically the pre-existing politicians self-elected spokespersons, and extended surveillance to anything that moves in spacetime (ie: not just VIPs) making up the entire 2007-2015 public history, judicials included. Again: did you get why there's no "message integrity" in our tools? How do they fake everything if every bit is blockchained? The Laziogate scandal is a good case study simply because it is smaller than the whole story of "message corruption", and it concerned the illegal access to ... register of births (!!!) in order to ... win elections!!! The most important registry, for the most sluggish cause. White Collars's High Shit. Trough the lack of message integrity. Did you get why I want to be anonymous (ie: no ID) on the global information system commonly called The Internet? Did you get why [the hackers manifesto was written at jail time](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html)? 

3. In a blockchained version of the same documents, this can't happen because the ID of the following document is a result of the contents of all the previous ones; there's no way to fake them all, and there's no way to validate a fake one ex-post. Even torturing the small IT guy, he can't do what has been asked for: any attempt to crack one of the blockchained docs would trigger a waterfall of errors that would trigger an unpredictable waterfall of alarms. Any message corruption would result in getting busted faster and harder. 

## <a name="solution"></a>Solution? 

The (childhood) dream of all of us, from one of our martyrs

> Announcing the Open Library ( [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/openlibrary) )

a (naif) distributed tool

> InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), is a content-addressable, peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol. Nodes in the IPFS network form a distributed file system. ( [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) )

the (crypt) financial tool

> Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the burdens of going through a financial institution. ( [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.general/12588/) )

the (crypt) new contracts law

> Ethereum is a cryptocurrency platform and Turing-complete programming framework intended to allow a network of peers to administer their own stateful user-created smart contracts in the absence of central authority. ( [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) )

Findings:

1. [Paul Baran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran)'s idea. This idea of distributed telecommunication system keep popping up since 1964 because mankind simply need it. No activism, no hacktivism, no politics, no nothing: it's just the most efficient, reliable, resilient way to build an information system. It stands by itself. 

2. Ethereum is a very minimal contracting tool suitable for any kind of contract: from constitutions, to business, to marriages. It produces a strong registry that can be made public in parts or as a whole, evolved, and metering any information exchange from inception of the contract to the closure. And this metering is a very predictable energy function. The only connection with the steel&fire economy is electricity. No labor, no money, no other common entities: that part come on top according to individual and common laws, traditions, habits. 

3. The developers themselves are warning all around the young age of their project; nobody at this early stage can assert the integrity of a system. Please, don't take this text as a technological review of Ethereum: I've only red a very little of their website. I'm just a believer. The day I've money to incept a project or I'm hired into an Ethereum-driven one, I'll tell you more. 

4. Finally, code is law. 

## <a name="constitution"></a>Constitution? 

> Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time. ( [Winston Churchill](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206) )

Findings:

* TODO

## Timeless.

> One might think this means that imaginary numbers are just a mathematical game having nothing to do with the real world. From the viewpoint of positivist philosophy, however, one cannot determine what is real. All one can do is find which mathematical models describe the universe we live in. It turns out that a mathematical model involving imaginary time predicts not only effects we have already observed but also effects we have not been able to measure yet nevertheless believe in for other reasons. So what is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds? ( [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) )

* [Intel x86 considered harmful - Joanna Rutkowska - 1.0 - October 2015](http://mfp19.github.io/resources/x86_harmful.pdf)

> Sadly, and most depressing, there is no option for us users to opt-out from having this on our computing devices, whether we want it or not. The author considers this as probably the biggest mistake the PC industry has got itself into she has every witnessed.

* [State considered harmful: A proposal for a stateless laptop - Joanna Rutkowska - 1.0 - December 2015](http://mfp19.github.io/resources/state_harmful.pdf)

> Personal computers have become extensions of our brains. This symbiosis is only going to strengthen in the years to come, and not just metaphorically! The
author believes it should be paramount for humankind to ensure we can trust our personal computers. Unfortunately the industry does not seem to share this opinion.

Those Rooty's documents, on pair with the modern arts masterpieces (Kim.Com, Assange, Manning, Snowden), the Anonymous bitcoin developers, and the well known Ethereum developers complete the millennium job. Theoretically, at least. Most of the findings Joanna Rutkowska had about the Intel silicons are exactly the same for all the other families of consumer silicons (AMD, ARM-based, etc) as a result of the current commercial and military policies. Most of the findings Joanna Rutkowska had about laptops are easily applicable to the smartphones and any other mobile device. And currently we are using those. 

Do you remember that movie... what was... Fight Club: a guy with a psychiatric relevant medical condition - I don't like the word "schizofrenia" - one day enter his boss's office, try to extort a better wage and his boss call the building security to kick him out, so he starts to boxe himself in his face and fall on purpose over a crystal shelf breaking it, as well as breaking his back. As a result his boss is jailed for assaulting one of his employee and he gets a good stack of money from insurances and alike. We are all doing something similar every time we use a telephone: fixed, mobile, dumb, smart. One exception only: the 3000 euros military ones. 
I don't know how the other hackers feel in this world, and I'm really envy of all of those that can make their day in such context. But about myself I have something to regret: I'm too slow to research&develop ways out. We get those finely crafted hackish documents when it is basically useless to read them because we've been already fucked up using the contents of those documents. We have the laptop ones now, when most of the people switched to tablets and smartphones. And starting from Joanna's final guessing about ARM-based smartphones it will take even longer to get a good summary paper about the smartphones era, because of two main reasons: the integration and miniaturization process goes far beyond any chance for anyone to make any kind of HW peer review of a modern smartphone (note: I'm talking about the datapath inside the cpu, not the amazing color of the glossy case); some of those tools are written in languages not accessible from us (ex: I got a chinese one and a russian one, in both cases I couldn't understand the boot process log... and go figure what else after). In all this, all the legacy shit sounds simply ridicolous.

* [2015 Ambulance Chasers's Call to Arms](http://mfp19.github.io/resources/Delibera_19_2015_Astensione_30.11-4.12_def.pdf) (Italian lawyers reporting fundamental abuses in the judicial system), and the [sanitized version](http://mfp19.github.io/resources/lawyers_absents.txt) of it (mentally sanitized: bare text file, git hashes it). 

> once the modern age push has ended even in the criminal judicial context, the on-going new political patterns and the new kind of judges that interpret not only the law, but also the scope and the values of the law, produces an incremental destructive crisis for the rule of law (it. "legalita'") and limitation of law (it. "riserva di legge") principles. It is impossible to accept these huge challenges using the existing tools. 

By searching for the proper translation of the italian constitutional limit to the law, called "riserva di legge", Yahoo found the book "[On the Limits of the Law: The Ironic Legacy of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act](http://www.amazon.com/On-Limits-Law-Ironic-Legacy/dp/0801848970)"

> On the Limits of the Law is Stephen Halpern's compelling examination of the legal struggle to control the enforcement of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- the historic provision prohibiting racial discrimination in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Although the provision appeared to have immense power to fight racial inequality in education,Halpern argues, attacking the problem through legal rights and litigation distorted our understanding of educational inequality based on race and limited the remedies used to address it.

And I tought that he addressed the same issue I played around in [Antelitteram](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/29/Antelitteram.html), [NotActivist](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html), [NotPublish](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html): "attacking the problem through legal rights and litigation distorted our understanding" of the current times. Probably the book can talk about the american common law system; for sure better than [what I did](http://mfp19.github.io/2016/01/01/Standing.html). 

Shall our ancestors be proud and the future smile to you all. Thank you all, for all those emotions.

[The experiment side of the story](http://mfp19.github.io/about/) is ok, there are enough self-contained references to space, time, people, and their acts, scattered all around the git repository ready to be ported into a distributed blockchained version of it; I must remove the external references (ex: YouTube videos, external Websites, etc) and embed them into the repository itself, because there's no [resilient, high available, freely accessible, universal library in place, yet](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/15/Solution.html). Technologically wise is easy (IPFS is one of the many examples), but I can't figure out how to do it (again) without stepping (again) on some of that shit typically found in the [legal labyrinth](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html#publish) that makes our lives impossible and harder than what should be: "my internet!" (Microsoft), "no, my internet!" (Google), "ok, our internet!" (Facebook), "sorry, I don't want to be your!" (Diaspora), "ok, your internet too, but money are mine only!" (Apple), "why money are yours only?" (Samsung), "because I came first!" (Apple-Samsung patents war), "and what about who comes after?", "After? What about who came before! They didn't make us trademark the word Windows and now Apple wants the words App Store?" (Microsoft) ... and so on ... and on, and on ... year after year ...

We could have invented something better than the reptilians, the phreakers, and the computer hackers nowadays! With the The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse things got better (then the UIkipedians alone!) but ... again ... do we really need to re-write everytime aaaaaaaaaall the bible-like books again before getting to the point? 

Anyway: I have no idea of the final result, shape, content, of this writing, yet. I don't know how to make it comprehensible. 

> Joyce himself never defined exactly what he meant by epiphany ([The James Joyce Centre](http://jamesjoyce.ie/epiphanies/))

Probably some tools to linearize the hypertext - an index and a chapter summary - for printing purposes are enough. I'm used to jump from one point to another one, thanks to some pre-hypertext books I was hungry for, when I was young: fantasy "game-books" where you could drive your story by jumping from one numbered chapter to another one changing your own timeline, storytelling, wave of emotions. But humans tend to loose their patience when they can't grasp a clue; for me is true in front of some mind games, for others with "harmonic texts".

We even invented the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) to grasp armonic clues, and then the discrete-time Fourier transform to account our reality by numbering the armonic clues, and then the fast Fourier transform to do it billions of times per second: nowadays it turbo-boosts the [Porn](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pr0n) delivery speed on our displays; chats and financial graphs included. It drives our planes, cars, motorbikes and go figure what else: more than the average understanding of the whole thing.

There's a funky italian song too!

> Members are rapper J-Ax (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini). In the spoken intro of Strade di Città, it is stated that the band is named after the article of the Irish constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press, although it must be noted that article 31 of the Irish constitution is not about the freedom of the press. They probably meant the Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articolo_31 )

Here it is 

> During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, 1968-1994, censorship was used principally to prevent Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) interviews with spokespersons for Sinn Féin and for the IRA. 
> ... 
> In 1991, European Commission of Human Rights upheld the ban in case Purcell v. Ireland, though not unanimously. The Section 31 broadcasting ban lapsed on 19 January 1994 because it was not renewed by Minister for Arts, Culture & the Gaeltacht Michael D. Higgins, eight months prior to the August 1994 IRA ceasefire. ( [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#The_Troubles) )

Note: a quick (incomplete) translation. 

> Natalino Balasso - New Year's speech 2016
> 
> Hi all, we have left the 2015 behind our shoulders and we challenge the 2016: what are we talking about? Numbers. Some people think - wrong - that the comedians can bring people to new levels of consciusness but looking at actual results it is possible to say that consciusness is overrated: humans make love, dogs have sex. Consciusness is just a matter of lexicon. In the while time, despite our 86 billions of neurons, the dogs have sex way more than what the humans do; and Bonobos are doing way better than the dogs: the smartest race on the planet. People that fuck 12 times a day to keep society quiet and calm the nerves. We self-castrates and blame Freud for it: people don't need artists, need jesters[1] because people is not able to have fun without. The jester is nearby the power, because the jester keeps the people, like drugs keep people unconscius, and after the unconsciusness treatment the people cross the road, someone turn on the headlights on full beam and speed up. 
> 
> I know that you would like something consolatory, something like me saying that bank frauds against little savers are a shame: banks do it, we already know it, but... to give 200 grands to a bank is like play the nudist in jail! The bank frontdesk is not dangerous by itself, but if you introduce yourself to that desk using your ass ... who you want to blame then? I've never had 200 grands to invest: if I die tomorrow, my bank loose money. But having those money, I would differentiate my investments: some money on the drugs market, some on the spirits market, some on the pay-tv market, and so on. 
> 
> What I ask to you instead is: why do you want for me to talk BAD about the politicians that YOU voted for. I already have plenty problems by myself: public television don't air my comedy because there are references to sex and religion, swearings, and we are not in a spacetime worm-hole, we are not in 1964: you think I'm going to lick the balls to public television's managers? They told me to change the words of my comedy and this is the art's death. It means that what you see on TV is not written by Freemen, it is written by people that need to lick the balls! I don't change anything of my comedy, and I know that this makes someone upset because if you are a Freeman, you're existence by itself makes the slaves upset! And we are lucky because our Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had to clean up the public TV from politics: today's public television have a council so liberal that Scelba[2] looks like Gandhi. 
> 
> What do you really want for me to say in a consolatory speech? Do you want for me to say that (note: Prime Minister) Renzi promised one thing and made a different thing? Are you nut? Or you're kidding me? Do you really think that policitians can make anything without preventive authorization to the profiteering gluttons sect? The politician is like a kid on daddy's legs, truly believing to be driving the car because the steering wheel is in his hands! And we are there, fighting in the bars, eating hard to chew frozen brioches ... because of those kids! Is it the blonde kid more cute than the dark one? And I apologise to the Northern League Party guys for the word Moro[3]. I know, I have to respect your vote, in fact I respect it because I'm speaking about you and I'm serious but ... I've to admit that my asshole is laughing. Because I can't understand how you can go from "God River Po", that is blasfemy, to the nativity scene, without laughing. It is not possible! And please, stop saying on Facebook that I talk shit about the Northern League Party in order to get more Likes: do you really think that I live on Facebook's Likes? Do you know that most of the theatres are public managed by the thousands of Northern League managed town councils ... and I get my food from there! And you know how many more tell me... not only the Northern League! I'm tempted to read here the letters I receive from theatres's directors saying: "if you don't change your comedies you can't work here any more". Ongaro, director of Veneto's permanent theatre wish had never produced my comedy: his ass is burning so much that he walks always nearby some walls even without rain. Do you really thing that with all the pig-thick-skin I have in my stomach, I'm afraid of 4 words you leave to me on Facebook? Do you think I have fear of the shit you throw at me? I live in the shit. I share my house with bullfrogs. Rising the level is futile: I live down under. I fly under the radars. You cannot offend me because you can't perceive me. 
> 
> What do you want for me to say in a consolatory speech: to talk bad about someonelse's religion? We have already too many trobules because of our religion! When I was a kid the nuns told me I would have burned in hell in the case I don't exec their orders, burning of excruciating pain in the ethernal flames. Think how pitiful that life. And I'm not talking about mine! I'm talking about those poor nuns's life: at 40-50 years old they must go around with that think on their heads and make up stories for kids. About Bill Murray saying that in some countries half of the people goes around with beekeeping dresses, it worries me a lot about the consciusness level of the planet, but I don't oppose to it. I don't have the same bipolar approach: "For not being part of the blood-sucking mosquitos, we are part of the shit-eating flies". 
> 
> Or do you want for me to console you all saying that the Five Star Movement is a remotely servo-controlled device? It is true but I don't give a fuck about parties, I don't give a fucking shit of polit... even in my comedy I never talk about parties! I talk about the deamons inside us, I'm not one of those loosers pretending to be satyrs by hammering one time the iron and one time the wood of the barrel: if I could, I would rather hammer the pub owner's wife, because that poor man has always to live her alone to go having a look at the accounting made without him in place. I'm talking about ourselves, believing to be democratic, blaming others to be racist, and don't realise the racism inside us. We don't analyse it. When the taxi driver is arab I keep my hand on the door handle but I don't do it on purpose: it is pre-conditioning. When I see the Gay Pride Parade, my asshole gets smaller; I don't make it on purpose: it's just pre-conditioning. If I see a woman parking a car I think she can't do it because I don't like her; but if I like her, I ask her if she wants for me to help her parking. And I help her parking because I hope to fuck her. And maybe she is having the same fantasies. And after that we eat psycho drugs and watch tv-series because we are not Bonobos. But I never ever helped a truck driver to park! Yes we know that... probably the truck driver is probably more in need of help!

> To make it short: we are all good in watching others' stupidity, our instead have no flavour. We got used to it. We blow it every day and we wave it. Think how racist we are about intelligence: we hate dumber people, that is a stupid approach already. If you ask to a dog to bring you a protractor and it doesn't happen, do you get angry with the dog? Angry with a guy that in order to understand another guy ... needs to sniff his ass?

> And another aspect is that we always must find who's guilty for something; things simply can't just happen. Let's say that your grandpa dies at 94 years, for you is not enough to accept that he was old, just ageing; no, you sue the hospital ... they might have done something wrong but ... with other's mistakes we are animals, with ours we are more permissive than Madre Teresa. In this we are backwards when compared with barbarians: if one walks reading WhatsApp and break his head on a street light, it ends up citing the town council in court because the street light should not be there. The barbarian instead would just watch around to see whether someone notice his stupidity, second he would quickly stand, and third he would ask himself how come that he has been so idiot. We can't stop being bullocks and because of this, we made up an entire art out of being bullocks. It's cool to drive a jetski, it's cool to get fat out of spirits and talk like an ape, it's cool to smoke industrial tobacco ... the most stupid thing of the world: to suck smoke, keep the toxic part only, and spit smoke. Vomiting high volume music out of the car and the club, it's so cool to have so broken ears at the point that Kingkong's farts sounds like Peter Pan's flaute. Smoking weed, to have an excuse for the bullshit we say, it's cool. We had to infiltrate the bullocks concept even in our laws: you think is normal to have a law that mandates barriers in the theatres so that you can't see the show but you can't jump down either? A bullock only would jump from the second floor of the theatre seats. I mean: the movie on stage have to be terrible!

> Think how much we are idiot whenever we chose one side; I make you an example in the soccer context because with politics we do the same thing...
