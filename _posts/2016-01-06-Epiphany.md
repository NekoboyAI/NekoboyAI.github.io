there's the need of something that closes properly the previous [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesis_anarchism) before going back, in the next years, to incrementally clean up and expand the whole repository and turn it into a clear and comprehensible english lecture. There's the need of another synthesis. 

Any time I get this feeling, my mind goes back to 1 hour spent with James Joyce's nephew in Dublin; he was having weekly Free lectures at Joyce's home to help young students in decoding the [Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29). I wish I had the chance to understand their language. When I left that place I had only one tought: "I didn't understand anything; but one day... oh yeah... one day... I'll read the Ulysses too, and it must be in english". And walked away with an undefined good feeling in my heart. Once back home I bought a copy of it, and I left it on my library for the right time; a time I would have had enough life to understand what the crazy old guy wrote at the end of his life. Another Mission Impossible. Life's too short. 

> An epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, epiphaneia, "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of sudden and striking realization. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_%28feeling%29))

# <a name="structure"></a>Structure. 

A brief summary per each chapter. 

## <a name="test"></a>Sah sah sah ... Test. 

In this chapter the author - me - respect the tradition to say "Hi" in the most computer-fashioned way. It is a chapter a bit dry. Essential. Zen. 

The tradition predates back to the oscilloscopes tubes times, when ageing scientists used to get excited for turning a light on. A light that could be the detonation of the first nuclear bomb (without the feared chain reaction that could have burned the entire atmosphere), an hatch opening on the first lunar landing vehicle, or the statistical presence of the Higgs' Boson in a Large Hadron Collider made out of 9 nuclear power plants and an information system never seen elsewhere before. Lights that indicated respectively: survival, hope of future survival, chance to make that hope true. But normal people can't understand why a light can make navy officers and scientists excited. 

In this case we are observing a common case of post-C "Hi" transposed in a post-git and pre-bitcoin era. Did the author want to entirely skip Perl, ColdFusion, Java, PHP, Google, Facebook and RoR? (I'll wait the next 42-47 years for a a future archeologist to solve this dilemma, and a UIkipedian to stick a quote here in place of this sentence.) 

Probably the author should have titled "Foobar" instead of emulating a mic test; but the mic test keeps the door open to change a lecture into a speech, worst case: after a thermonuclear war computers doesn't work any more and someone have to tell good night stories to the kids!  

## <a name="integrity"></a>Integrity. 

> In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Integrity )

Findings: 

1. Without documents integrity there's no reason to produce documents: birth certificates, driving licences, diplomas, police reports, court orders, banknotes, property certificates. Any could be fake. Think about one of those, one only, to change every time is handled to the next hop, so that one person see something, the next see something else, and so on, until the last one issue a death bounty truly convinced to have made a righterous sentence. You've got Facebook in countries where hearsay trigger investigations and there's the death penalty at the end of the process. Something so obvious that I feel shame to have abused of your time by using 5 rows of text. 
An example of the chance that a document could be manipulated ex-post, is the pdf files after introducing in their specs the chance to link to external resources (early 2ks?). In a blockchained version of the same documents, this can't happen because the ID of the following document is a result of the contents of all the previous ones and their moving; there's no way to fake them all, and there's no way to validate a fake one ex-post. Even torturing the small IT guy, he can't do what has been asked for: any attempt to crack one of the blockchained docs would trigger a waterfall of errors that would trigger an unpredictable waterfall of alarms. Any message corruption would result in getting busted faster and harder by an unpredictable amount of people. With the exception of professional killers, mafia boys, and their lawyers - because it takes longer to figure out they can profit from it as well - the rest of us should be in the streets asking for the blockchain to become true. One only request to our governments. And it didn't happen: why?

2. Unfortunately our devices can't grant message integrity: by using blockchains on top of unsecure devices we could produce something even worse. As well as multiple national interests and business assets produce a world legal framework impossible to decode: in some countries (notably USA) militaries inject bugs in the companies's products because their legal system was built on top of those surveillance practices; for them is just NORMAL administration, in a well established system able to arrest 1 person every 40 seconds even for minor crimes (ex: mariuana); performance wise, simply impressive. In some other countries (ex: Italy), by not having the companies at home, governments can't policy the companies producing our devices to push state surveillance, so they rely on "cloud services" (ie: accessing data in a "unauthorized or undetected manner" and moving data in another jurisdiction, example another NATO country) and contractors to produce in-home spying tools (ex: Hacking Team). Others don't even attempt to spy: their cops break at home, seize the devices, and eventually torture (ex: jail before fair trial) to have the passwords. In every case the result are devices we can't trust (see [resources](#resources) for a summary of the past years). And this is an overall blocking problem not for commercial reasons, but for evolutionary reasons. We developed those tools in order to scale up to 8 billion monkeys: we simply can't live without anymore because our performance would be underachieving; unless we make a war big enough to decimate the human population. 

3. The italian [Laziogate scandal](http://unamericanaaroma.com/2012/07/23/to-rome-with-dignity/) is a good case study because it is smaller than the whole story of "message corruption", and concerned the illegal access to ... central public register of births (!!!) in order to ... win elections (!!!): the most important registry, for the most sluggish cause. The scandal itself is just a small insignificant detail emerged from the ... explosion of the old italian internal security agency SISMI: [SISMI and CIA kidnap a muslim imam in Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Omar_case), some kind of shortcircuit between black ops and judges prompted the [SISMI-Telecom scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISMI-Telecom_scandal) in which about 5000 VIP people, since 1996, were illegally surveilled. If you keep digging you'll find cops, military police (Carabinieri), financial police (Guardia di Finanza), etc, manipulating people in order to trigger the production of fake documents, up to 2007 reform of the agencies SISMI/SISDE into [AISE/AISI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenzia_Informazioni_e_Sicurezza_Esterna), the destruction of the files (instead of having public trials), and so on. So don't dig that season: as the american chick stated on her blog about Laziogate ([first link above](http://unamericanaaroma.com/2012/07/23/to-rome-with-dignity/)): "Usually I could care less about politics here in Italy. You’d need a freaking Ph.D. and then some to even touch the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand it all, anyways". I have that "freaking Ph.D." and my advice is to just take for good that the whole italian information system was broken: that's the only interesting point about "message integrity". The whole italian story is fake. Trough message corruption and partisan backtraces (ex: simple untold truths). A whole story of message corruption. Laziogate just an insignificant detail (of message corruption) involving an italian politician [Francesco Storace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Storace) alleged (and acquitted about 6 years later) of manipulating that very important registry (births&deaths! And I've spotted the prosecutors offices denying data first, and publishing fake data after behing debunked of denying data!). White Collars's High Shit trough the abuse of a centralized registry: the italian voting system required to collect a certain amount of signatures in order to register the candidates for elections, they've been collecting signatures one year only, photocopying them, and re-using the same copies every year; the result was a continual use of signatures of dead people, people that changed party in time, ecc; Alessandra Mussolini forked from Storace's party and he (or someone else) tried to access those registries to mangle the issue and don't loose votes. But those registries were public! The italian privacy law mandates privacy for private registries only! The problem was that Storace himself (as well as ALL the others) couldn't make this issue public because of the bottom line of using fake signatures to register for elections. Ridicolous the detail itself. Ridicolous the reactions (judicial included). Ridicolous that he (and we) got a judicial answer 6 years later (just to rehab his picture). It's all pretty ridicolous.
And there's no need to dig that story because in the new exciting season of "Who Wannabe Suverign in Italy?" history simply repeated: after a new shower of scandals (MOSE, EXPO, MafiaCapitale), they just admitted (2015) the failure of the new extraordinary AISE/AISI system that followed the SISMI/SISDE ones. Basically the pre-existing politicians self-elected spokespersons, and extended surveillance to anything that moves in spacetime (ie: not just 5000 VIPs), trough the 'cloud services' (ie: accessing data in a "unauthorized or undetected manner" and moving data in another jurisdiction, example another NATO country), making up the entire 2007-2015 public history, judicials included. And many law practitioners - even today - didn't realize it! Don't even suspect the chance for their documents to be manipulated off side track, in their mailboxes, by militaries, the prosecutors offices, Google/Facebook/Whatever officers, solos, or alike. Lawyers, attorneys, managers, use plain text gmail accounts on bugged devices, instead of end-to-end encryption and a public blockchain on armoured devices reviewed by indipendent security escrow companies: a self-encrypted, public, general purpose, registry, built on top of a distributed/decentralized recursively hashed archive. Cops are playing Duck's Hunt.
Nowadays in Italy we can't distinguish institutions from mafia any more, but to be fucking honest, the italian republic should offer honorary citizenship to that muslim guy, and the Vatican should have included him (kidnapped in Milan, transferred to Egypt, tortured, and acquitted!) in their christian saints calendars (if he wants to): San Antonio da Padova, San Daniele di Steccania, San Gennaro di Bisceglie, ..., San Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr. Mandatory minimum: he (unwillingly) help to figure out the entire nation-wide scandal!

4. Did you get why there's no "message integrity" in our tools? A blockchained version of the public registries would not allow those "unauthorized or undetected" mods to public registries. It would not authorize Google, Facebook, OpenID - the militaries, the fraudolent politicians - and all those websites asking if you want to use one of those registries to identify yourself on another website, to let someone (a Google operator or a public officer) to corrupt the message, any message: birth certificates, driving licences, diplomas, police reports, court orders, banknotes, property certificates. Because they would not own the entire registry. Go now to have a look at birthdate of MD5, SHA and the other tech the blockchain is made of. And remember that those tech have been considered weapons (ie: ammos) up to the end of the 90s. By pushing those techs trough the most powerfull distributed engine (ie: o'businessah! o'monnee!), the institutions delayed for decades the wide adoption of safe tools; right (ex: pre-existing war issues, forced human development timings, etc) or wrong (ie: profeetering gluttons on command). Did you get why [the hackers manifesto was written at jail time](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html)?

## <a name="solution"></a>Solution?

> Announcing the Open Library ( [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/openlibrary) ) 

The (childhood) dream of many of us, from one of our martyrs: a fully distributed system. This one instead is a (naif) distributed file system

> InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), is a content-addressable, peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol. Nodes in the IPFS network form a distributed file system. ( [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) )

its financial tool

> Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the burdens of going through a financial institution. ( [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.general/12588/) )

the new contracts law

> Ethereum is a cryptocurrency platform and Turing-complete programming framework intended to allow a network of peers to administer their own stateful user-created smart contracts in the absence of central authority. ( [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) )

Findings:

1. [Paul Baran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran). This idea of distributed telecommunication system keep popping up since 1964 because mankind simply need it. No activism, no hacktivism, no politics, no nothing: it's just the most efficient, reliable, resilient way to build a scalable information system; scaling from single individual monkey, to the entire universe. The only weird thing is that there are modern "inventors" claiming patents on this 1960 idea. They keep reproducing the same patterns at different scales and filing patents at the patents office for the same thing: message passing, renamed. From the electron (nanometers scale) to satellites (kilometers scale) it is always message passing and it has always the same solutions. 

2. IPFS is a Yet Another Distributed File System with some interesting features: hashing and caching every file, using private devices as a whole data bin. P2P. If we consider the new parallel silicon memories (ex: SSD) - ie: there's no need to organize information in series, to stream it on a tape or a rotating disk - we can easily imagine IPFS to be the only one FS standing in a few years. 

3. Bitcoin is a bag containing billions of unique identifiers written on silicon. Digital Cash. In the same way paper banknotes are billions of unique value identifiers written on paper. Cash. The only difference is that bitcoins are bound each other, their owners, and blockchained to the whole infrastructure; the banknotes are bound to banks and govs (and their costs; bloated). Three the problems ahead: our silicon ([our devices](#resources)) is not reliable because bugged ex-ante (by mistake or spy games), bugged ex-post (by mistake or spy games), or impossible to defend (exactly like a wallet on a well dressed person); people can't distinguish electronic currency from digital cash; abusers tend to look at bitcoins value (in dollars and euros) to Wannabe Millionaire, instead of appreciating it as a token (ie: a valid monetary reserve). And of course, it spawned a huge amount of legends. Example: "the chinese got all the bitcoins!"; they are the 25% of the human population, and they produce 60% of the human products... it's just NORMAL for any eagle-eye sitting behind a monitor, to notice that the majority of the bitcoin transactions are on the wires from wherever to China. It would be surprising in the case they were on the wires to Norway (0.1% of world population) or Israel (less than 0.1%)! That's why I called "abusers" all those eagle-eyed people: they confuse the metering tool with the metered distance. 

4. Ethereum is a very minimal contracting tool suitable for any kind of contract: from constitutions, to business, to marriages. Ethereum sits on top of the huge hash-base produced by the Bitcoin project: the decentralised (not distributed!) nature of Ethereum can overcome some of Bitcoin's current limits (ex: transaction rate too slow). Ethereum produces a strong registry that can be made public in parts or as a whole, evolved, and metering any information exchange from inception of the contract to the closure. And this metering is (in the same way Bitcoin is) a very predictable energy function. The only connection with the steel&fire economy is electricity. No labor, no money, no other legacy entities: that part come on top according to individual and common laws, traditions, habits, philosophies, religions, languages. I din't list politics. As far as I've been searching I haven't found any culture on Earth that can't make use of that tool; the only dramatic limits are the judicial practices that involve torture (jail included) and death penalties, but those are sad old well known problems that have not much to do with an information tool.

5. The developers themselves are warning all around the young age of their projects; nobody at this early stage can assert the integrity of a system. Please, don't take this text as a technological assesment of quality for IPFS and Ethereum: I've only red a very little of their website. I'm just a believer. The day I've money to incept a project or I'm hired into an Ethereum-driven one, I'll do some math to understand the implications of using a limited (huge) set of hashes, and I'll tell you more. By now I just trust the younger reservoir dogs for searching water in the desert.

4. Finally, code may be law... ehm... still... which one!?!? 

## <a name="constitution"></a>Constitution? 

> Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time. ( [Winston Churchill](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206) )

Findings:

1. Winston Churchill is one of the men I'd really like to ask if it is worth changing the democracy we had with the one I feel the need of. 

2. Despite the huge differences among the europeans, there have been an all around top-down program to eradicate the europeans' constitutions (and alike) to produce a single (un)overdefined european top-down administration. The chaos level in the judicial systems raised to hell; actually, the hell raised up to heart. The resulting blockade to access the judicial systems (Justice?) is well-known. The amounts of human rights violations is unknown. The whole process underachieving. 

3. Civil law countries tend to produce and reproduce an infinite amount of useless books and extern (transport, exile) who can read them. Common law countries tend to bash, judge and jail/extern whatever is not in line and in time with the rule of law. The Internet has been used as a tv-enabled washing machine to be placed in front of the shithole in order to watch free Pr0n while sitting on the water closet. As a result the most hybridized systems (notably France) are - sadly, because those are wiser - paying the judicial bill.

4. Some of the functions of old tools (legacy parliamentary works, and different kind of electronic decision-making tools: LiquidFeedback, Vilfredo.org, ecc.) should be ported into the very last tools popped out from universities and summer camps in order to produce a true mass driven legit safeguard against abuses. One of the hands-on examples of Ethereum is to build up a [democratic autonomous organization](https://www.ethereum.org/dao). 

5. Every single person can spawn its own "constitutional work" using this tool instead of the legacy way I produced mine in 2008. By using the same minimal tool, any future integration attempt with other legal work (individual or group) can be easily merged providing a semantic map: none of those persons or groups are treacherous, because permanently exposed; public. It's the beauty of the technological standards. Previous art: the TCP/IP (stack of) protocol(s) produced trough the RFC system in a multi-stakeholder fashion. 

6. The dilemma between having or not having a constitution for granular well-formed human rights can be considered solved: the Ethereum smart contracts capabilities can make any constitution totally fluid. The questions still open are about its contents only: what can be raised at constitutional level without treading some beliefs and at the same time keeping the overall figure economically achievable? 

## Timeless.

> One might think this means that imaginary numbers are just a mathematical game having nothing to do with the real world. From the viewpoint of positivist philosophy, however, one cannot determine what is real. All one can do is find which mathematical models describe the universe we live in. It turns out that a mathematical model involving imaginary time predicts not only effects we have already observed but also effects we have not been able to measure yet nevertheless believe in for other reasons. So what is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds? ( [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) )

Findings:

1. The theoretical base is given by a well formed theory (quantum mechanics) and the spectacular Stephen Hawking's popularization of the "imaginary time" concept. It took 60 years to mass distribute the results of the previous big theory, the electron. Don't be in a hurry for understanding the new one. I've been reading about it in the past 30 years with the eyes of a kid, then with the eyes (and math) of a teenager, then with the eyes (and math) of an engineering student, then with the eyes (and math) of a man ... and ... I didn't yet. 

2. There are plenty empirical evidences that show general asyncronicity among human beings: drugs, rapid crossing of timezones (ie: jetlag), prolongued isolation states, etc. Once given - again, in my case by trust not by knowledge - Hawking's words for good, the financial theories can be applied to single individuals intead of groups of individuals (ex: family, nation, etc). 

3. The blockchain system can serve as a networked stabilizer for any recognised spacetime abuse in the legacy legal and financial frameworks (ex: insider trading and plenty financial products, different kinds of scams, etc). 

4. In the chapter an example is given using some legacy simpler theories and elementary math: "ecu = euro * i", "ether = euro * i". 

## <a name="aethernum"></a>Aethernum.

> Panta rhei (from ancient Greek, en. "everything flows")

Findings:

1. Despite its volatility and the overal problem of having secure devices, the Bitcoin is a well established monetary reserve. The Ethereum Foundation bought bitcoins (value reserve) in order to sell Ethers. The Ethereum blockchain uses "gas" (a fraction of Ether) to account its operations and permanently register exchanges between miners and contractors. The unit "gas" is electricity, an implicit duty stamp to reroute every technostructural cost back to natural resources management without the need of human intervention (ie: frauds, slavery, ecc). The website is pretty childish but the concept seems valid both for information work accounted in the time domain ( euro = (ether * t) / tau ) and atoms work accounted in product units ( euro = (ecu * shoe) / tau  ). It's pretty simple: who chat more, pays more. For fun or for profit doesn't matter: must pay for the electricity spent. The SMSs on mobile phones were similar; but instead of paying 15 cents per sms (160 chars) to buy Telecom Italia's manager's cocaine and ENEL's manager's cocaine, you pay ENEL's manager's (more) cocaine (only). It's a step forward. Maybe, one day, instead of looking at all those european worthless policies to remove operator's fees and Regulate The Market, we'll see an european policy to remove the managers and Regulate The Europeans. Issue solved. But until then, think positive and be happy for having half psycopaths only on command! Rome wasn't built in a day.

2. By evaluating a tau for each individual (ex: some of the [IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) math can be recycled to do something way better than that), it is possible to adapt production times, production units, retail prices, wages, and everything, to the single individuals using a rational equation that granularly takes into consideration the single individual's capabilities and needs. Example: a person with handicaps could have an artificially (by law) setting for his tau so that predefined products (ex: survival medicines) cost less, zero, or is even reimbursed for buying. 

3. Someone says that the evaluation of tau could lead to the end of privacy in a similar fashion the attitude tests did; indeed it is possible to self-asses tau using the proper Turing-test-like procedure. In the past decades psychos made plenty experiments on other humans; it is pretty easy to find good books about 'double blind' procedures today. And I can personally witness that many human beings are not able to identify a very simple bot from a human: around 1997 I piped an 80s AI called eLiza to an IRC chat, left it chatting, and in one of the logs I've found a guy that apparently got excited and masturbated on his keyboard thanks to the sweet words of my eLiza. For people like him there's no need to disturb NASA to have a supercomputerised reference in order to let individuals self asses their timings: an hamster's wheel from the corner's pet shop is enough. By the way: that's the day I stopped to chat on IRC; and one of the reasons why I've never had a blog, a facebook/twitter account, and whatever crap has been produced since 2001. Other apocaliptic theories may spawn (but we are all used to those): price discrimination, capitalism's destruction, etc. And those fearmongers may be right: in a few months since the launch of Ethereum someone have already built spiders to use the blockchain as a data source, and it is selling the spider work for profit: younger guys coming out of universities got Big Data jobs and Facebook in their phones; they've never had the chance to develop a privacy discipline. How long it will take before the first blowjob video pops up on the blockchain instead of YouTube and the Moral Practitioners Association of the time will produce their political puppet in order to pass a new law to go searching for blowjobs in the blockchain too? Moral Guys: I'm ONE KIND OF blowjob seeker too, but THAT kind of search you want for politicians to do, must be done by tech instead; not by law! You must pay me to search for blowjobs for you. No, wait, the last sentence doesn't sound good ... actually, I don't want to be paid for that, I've my strong work ethic that forbid for helping the moral guys to search for blowjobs (and saves me ex-ante from ambigous situations) ... but yes, you must make a spider that tags and list all the contents you don't want to be stored in your memories, devices, premises, ecc; for kids, youself, or whatever; then share those lists with the other moralizers; so that all the houses of all the moralizers only, are moralized. Grab a 1000 new parents and in a few months there won't be sex and violence on your screens. YouTube can't do it for you.

4. The UN Declaration of Human Rights (or any other local equivalent) can be used to re-offset economics so that "needs" are always satisfied (ex: 50 liters of water and 2500 kcal per day, per person). That paper was made in a true moment of need; when all the work was manpower and we enslaved animals to get help; and the first machines we figured out have been used for personal and nation supremacy. The entire re-offsetting system can be simulated in public: just think that we are at the end of the third world war and we must keep living somehow, so we need to rebuild with whatever is around, starting from our last mistakes. Some religions are based on this; those religious may help to imagine.

> Se invece del vitello, te danno er mulo, tu magna e statte zitto... e vaffanculo. (an old Rome's idiom, en. "If they serve you donkey meat instead of lamb, you'd better eat in silence first... and fuck off then")

Findings:

1. Probably a latin quote would be more appropriated; something like "primum vivere dehinde philosophare" (lt. "live first, imagine after"; you choose another verb in place of 'imagine'). I like to translate it with "survive first, all the rest come after". But trash philosophy and [dick-pics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M) are more trendy nowadays; so you must place a 'dick-pick' and a 'fuckoff' up and there in your writings; another 'mandatory minimum'. The quote above is a compromise between what I've been dreaming in my childhood - lamb - and what I've got in life - eDonkey. 

2. I haven't been able to access the judicial system for 8 years by now; and my eTools are all off-side-track manipulated. I'm currently writing on a laptop that from time to time horns; no kidding. When I started to write this Git I/O thing, I've spent an hour searching my name and digging my G+ profile to figure out how was it: there are messages repeating, messages I didn't write, posts published in reverse order, and so on. So I wrote an entire page about myself, timelined, in a tool where the history is tracked (ie: can't change idea off side track). I've been singing "[The Internet is for Porn]()" for so long that... porn makers - ANY et all - truly believe their content is the king. Nobody explained them the 'message in a bottle' paradigm the Internet is made of; the packet switching miracle: you write and MAYBE, in the next 20 years, if the host kept paying for the electricity all the 20 years long, someone will find your message. It happened again after I wrote this chapter (2015/12/26); the very first day of 2016: (a tourist) "ah, you are an IT Guy! My son too - note: 25 years old - is soooooo good with computers!", (me) "ooooh, I'm happy to hear that! What is he doing with a computer?", (a tourist) "He is a designer and a deejay!", (me) "Ah ok, he is not an IT Guy, he is a designer and a musician!", (a tourist) "Yes... well... I don't know exactly... I've spent a shitload to buy him a full set of gears, and he spends his days playing music and designing!". The "sfera paralela laica" people - "the non-clerical party", literally "the parallel lay sphere", an idiom used by lawyers to point at non-lawyers - have no idea of how many musicians and designers gone (financially) broken because of the cost of their toys. The amount of freelancers broken to catch up with the showbiz's technological standards. And of course, they have no idea of how much money are wasted OUTSIDE their homes! In particular in the marketing, and in the law, departments. Donkeys paying sex toys to their sons, unable to distinguish eLambs from iDonkeys.

3. My 2003-2009 girlfriend was an iDonkey as well, a going-to-be-lawyer iDonkey. She was asking whether or not I'd defend her from bandits in the case she would become a prosecutor; my answer: "no worry Horney, we'll buy kevlars instead of pigiamas, and shotguns instead of bed lights, so we'll die fucking hard in bed togheter! ROMANTIC FINAL!". I hate the idea to have a weapon in my home but ... I could live with it. What I couldn't live with, was that she was publishing our pictures on Facebook in some sort of left party program to re-educate to the Italian Constitution, after two years of chatting on it, and me repeating to please stop that shit. The day I was complaining for her to push my data in Facebook, and her replying "I show you how Facebook works: see? My friends only can see my profile!"... I've just gone mad: I've just had spent the past 4 years ridiculising myself in public, accepting crappy jobs to keep staying where medias were made, just for privacy sake, and ... I engaged with a young beautifull wannabe-prosecutor to risk a marriage with an ageing cheerleader in search of popularity (let's say it showbiz's way: "attention whore"). Google had already destroyed on-line privacy. Facebook instead, was [just a new modern case of environmental corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_pulite); privacy wise. Pretty interesting for my on-going research. So I switched my interest from engineers's shit - university fundings, patents, industrial spinoffs - to lawyers's shit: the biggest mistake of all my life. It was harder for me to understand the judicial environment because I had no judicial experience at all, and [since Big Brother's 1st edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_general_election,_2001) there was an insane push-pull public game about [sad cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogne_homicide) (note: jump to "Media exposure" section), going on the italian medias. But talking about inter-generational corruption, it was just more interesting. To be honest I can understand a blue collar massacred by rotational shifts not having time for fancy topics and smart conversations; and any poor guy that had no chances to access higher education; but I cannot understand a lawyer, a prosecutor, whatever is practitioning law. I cannot accept lawyers not reading and understanding the terms of service, not enforcing the public good by discussing their very own environment; they work in the part of society that rationally send people to the shithole, and to death in some jurisdictions. They can't take the money and run away. Lawyers must read those terms, understand, and discuss, instead of just clicking 'accept' to access their porn as soon as possible; and without the need of a maddog like me to bite their ass. We - their "non-clerical party" - can grab our dicks and run to the porn without reading any disclaimer; they simply can't. Who is supposed to monitor, and patrol, and bomb whenever necessary, the judicial system? Me? Too-late-activists... for dignity once-in-jail? An ex-inmate killing the judge as soon as he is released? This is the price of having idiots in court.

Findings:

1. Until 2005 I've been able to spot great consumer associations' products anaylisis from northern european countries; then no more. And in Italy those disappeared in the mid 90s. By 2010 all our devices were off side track bugged for surveillance purposes, or simply impossible to protect because of the spying tools installed in the data hubs (ie: outside our premises). The cheapest Software Defined Radio able to speed up to modern radio signals (WiFi/HSPA-LTE) and tell whether our calls are encrypted or not, was in the 3000 USD range. In the 2013-2014 period I made a quick estimate: to make a grassroot, high speed, mid size, custom general purpose computer board, using commercial silicon at consumer prices, takes around 100k (of a western currency unit); to make the same stuff in silicon takes about 500k. I had about 25$ in my pockets; summing up all my bank accounts. If I'd stolen property to the friendly people around me I'd probably reach 100$ (and a few tens of grand, of debts, with banks and public institutions, cops&robbers running after me, and being banished from my monkeysphere... exiled). A hypotetic computer association made of 1000 people - given that our decision assisted tools worked properly and we all agreed to steal money from our families, friends, ecc, to bet everything on that single project - could spawn a board; it is unlikely to be able to spawn a silicon chip. We can workaround the issue of the silicon chip by increasing the size of the resulting board; but this increases the cost of the board itself. And we can even avoid any electronics going back to pure mechanical tool; but this would increase the size of the resulting machine and the amount of energy needed to operate it. And when I say 'increase the size' and 'increase the energy' I mean that that association would need a small-coutry-sized piece of land, and a few nuclear power plants to operate that machine. Have a look at the Large Hadron Collider project, to have an example of 'size'. Unacceptable. And considering the amount of steamware to dig out from museums in order to have an equivalent mechanical tool (ex: ferro-magnetic coils to be used as memories), it looks like an horror movie: I've seen the pictures of Stallman singing latinos songs from his One Laptop Per Child around 2011, before the new southern-northern american street clashes that John Oliver (HBO) published on YouTube around 2014. That - see MadMax movies - is the other kind of hell that raise up when someone invokes the masses against the institutions, and we don't really want to live in ... ask to whoever has been there ... we call them 'refugees' for a reason.

2. There's a recurring question in my mind that makes me dumb all the times my toughts stomp into it: "can I speak?". I like the english version of the entity 'pensieri': 'toughts'. It is very real: "something imaginary that just happened in the past, gone". When nerves stand the slings and arrows of this outrageous life, hate speech is the same. It helps to reduce pressure. That's why I love it. The old grandma's recepe to survive honest is "[Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855)... and find your very own black hole where to throw all the rest". Note: if you follow the link notice the imperative and conditional verbs.

3. There are very good answers on earth, both at the top of the ladder (Royal level) and at the bottom of it (liberal arts: jesters, satyrs, comedians). Again: my personal references are the english crown at the top, the ancient greek comedians at the bottom, because of my very own background (2nd generation republican born after the last italian king); but what I can tell is: it is pretty similar everywhere in the world. Thai people (the people of the Thai Kingdom), thanks to english people and the other world wide expats living in Thailand, made me understand a bit better the meaning of the crowns, in my middle years; in Italy the only similar tradition is the Catholic Pope one (that I don't honour and refuse to honour because they keep taxing all the italians with the 8per1000 rule); the President of the Republic can be considered similar too because of his roles (head of the judges, head of the militaries, etc), and in both cases there's no blood rule: no crown, no feeling about it. We had a pre-WWII law that mandated to keep a picture of the king (the flag and the chatolic cross) in all the public offices; but when I was at high school (1991-1996) all those symbols were already gone; the only somewhat real feeling I could get in my own world are my memories of my talks with my grandma. Very little of useful reasoning in a huge amount of emotions; not really useful to understand differences between kingdoms and republics. Despite the late 19th century general idea to keep the church separated from public institutions, the Vatican State kept playing a major role all the way the past century thanks to their confessionals and some untold (and unauthorized) agreements; in UK, for comparison, even today the House of The Lords have a life long serving majority (700 out of 800) and a religious minority (25 out of 800) embedded in their parliament instead; that is somewhat more honest: the religious minority is openly represented instead of stealing money and manage them at will under the hood. 
About liberal arts instead; I had plenty all my life long (Dario Fo, literature Nobel Prize, is an all around Satyr); you can spot both very high and very low ancient forms of comedy all around the world as well: english have those, chinese have those, thai have those ... and so on. They all have different names, colors, timings; but everywhere there is (or used to be at least) one of those forms of art that can be staged in front of kings and queens. We still have the best examples - even of discussing the power, the blood rule, royals - under our eyes, we can see the best practices to survive in any formal environment without offending and according to the formal rules.

4. As far as kings, queens, presidents, popes, parliaments, allow at least one form of art to go on stage, and some speakers corners in public streets and parks, censorship by itself doesn't exist. In that chapter there's a list of reasons and feelings why it doesn't, and if it does it is criminal. I personally think that active protection of public speakers is compulsory too, no matter what; but in practice it is pretty hard to achieve: kids keep crying when we take them out of their comfortably belly water, Julian Assange is still bunkered in the Ecuador's embassy. Why so long? Who pays for the english law enforcement to keep the belt around the ecuador's embassy?

5. As far as kings, queens, presidents, popes, parliaments, allow some kind of public scrutiny with acceptable&certified timings, some level of surveillance is widely acceptable. Plus there is a very basic truth: we bring and spread our face/fingerprints/DNA around everyday, and our automated tools need a certain amount of logs in order to work properly and being debugged in the case of fault. Then we can point the fingers to any story - in that chapter I use some italian mafia and secret agencies ones - in order to achieve better procedures. Real time. Epsilon cost.

6. The blockchain system can solve any kind of public information issue up to the most difficult ones: think about the top most secret public documents distributed encrypted in a way that they are automatically disclosed within 75 years from facts (US public law, AFAIK; but it can be 25 years; or whatever law mandates). The UK's IPT-managed system could be evolved into an office that decide the amount of years at the moment of deploying a black operation, instead of deciding at judicial time whether or not is the time to release some docs or reimburse some victims. Alan Turing might have been pardoned before death, instead of 75 years later. Bitcoin - and all the profeetering gluttons it attracted - has been the proof of this chance: despite all the accidents (from a girl found dead in Singapore to plenty wallets stolen world wide; and in one case even by american federal cops!) the security agencies are certifying its integrity, some banks adopting those methods, some governments endorsing and embracing those tools to renovate their internals. It takes time to get to mass distributed results; the amount of time is a pretty complex function of demographics, economics, ecc, that varies from place to place. There are dangers, it can be used to harm people instead of make a better world, and there could be things that delay (more) the adoption of it but ... it's a good tool in our toolbox. Even if you are a criminal: do you really want to go around without a blockchain under your seat? What the hell of criminal are you without a blockchain, uh? Have you ever seen a punk without a chain coming out from his pockets, uh? Go asking for blockchains to your gov! :)

7. In order to achieve this, there's the need to restore the chance for hacktivists to make their own tools. Not by charity, and not by crowd-sourcing: it has to be public founded in a similar way the militaries are; with some clear public agreement and distinction at large, between the two, and a comparable amount of money. Hacktivists must be embedded in the formal systems as well as the protection of war veterans, war victims, families, elders, kids, has been in the past. Maybe it was not perfect, and money have never been enough. But it has the same permanent level of priority in any public agenda. It is more important then propaganda, marketing, psycho-stories, psycho-procedures, and whatever can be enclosed in a cloud service like Facebook or Google-whatever: refuse any backoffice guaranteed procedure ('the cloud') and ask for the money back in order to buy yourself your own piece of hardware to build up the mass distributed equivalent of those! It's a matter of distributed public capabilities to enforce the public trust: there must be people like me - psycho-identified since I was 11 years old - able to go from 25 dollars in their own bank account, to a self-secured electronic device without paying more than 25 dollars, and many people with all the other skillsets able to ask me wheter their current mobile calls are encrypted or not. Mandating universities to open the access to their labs could be a practical way to proceed: Aaron Swartz has been hammered on the basis of trademarks/copyright/patents laws, for distributing knowledge only, in a country where university documents are strictly private, the university computer labs are closed, but guns are sold at the hairdresser. I've been hammered by law in a country where universities are public founded and their presidents ('Rettore') sign NDA agreements with the industry only (ie: not giving value back to the public). In both countries the public opinion mainstream media is (has been?) ... Facebook! And those enterprises (Facebook, Google, etc) have been cherry-picking the Free beers instead of being liable by law for whatever happened to whoever have been using their services and devices, then providing fake solutions (ex: Facebook announce to not force people into using their real names, Google declaring availability to de-index personal data, modern web puppies burning public money for privacy class actions against Facebook) instead of being liable for whatever happened using their tools. De-list Facebook/Google and whatever marketing firm from the stock markets: they are a cost, not a stock. And thank you to have accounted the robbery in a company register: we know exactly how much money must come back.

>  Tiocfaidh ár lá (ga. "our day will come", [Bobby Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Sands))

Findings: 

1. There's an overall 15 years delay between facts and current spy stories, mass-surveillance chronicles and [apparent institutional motion](https://cdt.org/blog/did-the-european-court-of-human-rights-just-outlaw-massive-monitoring-of-communications-in-europe/). Jon Postel died in 1998. Edward Snowden popped out in 2013. The same pattern from any other country perspective, ex. Italy: gov wiretapping black boxes appeared in the italian peering points (Internet hubs) in 1999, hacktivists reported ROS (italian military special forces) poisoning the BGP routes in 2014. In the middle 15 years of data retention and e-commerce boosting policies. Fare-Well Europe. 

2. Activists and Hacktivists are different animals. The italian [Hacking Team scandal](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/543991/the-growth-industry-helping-governments-hack-terrorists-criminals-and-political/) clearly highlights the difference: activists are worried about consolidated, mature, civil principles (ex: freedom of the press); hacktivists care about the tools to make (also) those principles real (ex: freedom of being anonymous on automated graph-walking networks). It ends up that a factory/gov baked [reduction of device's attack surfaces](#resources), that would benefit both et all, is not even on the horizon of all those activists complaining for journalists spied. The little snitchers, whistleblowers, journalists, issue ... is a second tier issue. And, sadly, far from the masses as well: today even rocks and plants know to be monitored, but they are the only ones to not have anything to hide. And criminals are do not rely on those information tools; they have guns, don't need a smartphone for their business! Activists cannibalize hacktivists and fuck both.

3. The end result is a completely unreliable view of facts built on word of mouth, tagged by hearsay, and managed off side track even easier than before: [extraordinary renditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition) are easier today than before. Despite the wide experience matured in the human history - ex: the huge amount of existing voting systems - today's Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) is solved by simply sticking on one side and shitting on the other one to keep ruling the game: "for not being part of the blood-sucking mosquitos, we are part of the shit-eating flies" (Natalino Balasso, comedian; see below). Medias are enough to play this game; there's no actually need to work the problems out; once the storytelling is pumped in. A so thick amount of shit on this wall, that [Peppino Impastato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Impastato), and Bobby Sands, died again. And we, today, are diying too. The italian case reported in this chapter - seizures of hacktivists resources and their claims of connections between right wings activists and police - shows the last results of the shitstorm gone institutional when the current President of the Italian Republic - Sergio Mattarella - and the parliament of the time, in 1993, changed the 1946 voting law into a majority-based one; leaving in the proportional system the 25% of seats only. And barring minorities from having a representative: the Casa Pound far right extraparliamentary movement is one of those minorities (0.5% at 2013 general election) today. Who ever have been supporting the "digital rights" is one of those minorities as well; and it is orthogonal to both [the political and economical spectrums](http://www.politicalcompass.org/euchart) (ie: left/right wings division doesn't make sense at all because all of those need message integrity). In 2005, the second step toward the majority rule, excluded direct choice of representatives. To recap: no minority can be represented, the majority rule forced people to take one of two only sides in order to be represented, representatives are predetermined; without the checks&balances typical of the majority-based systems (ex: UK). Turning the whole voting machine into a mere confirmation ceremony without any chance of choice. In 2014 the constitutional court voided the 2005 electoral law mandating the current parliament to restore the connection between the people and representatives (art. 1 Constitution: "The suveregnity belong to the people"). The 2005 voting system produced a fully symmetric war. As a result of the long lasting repeated retaliation both sides have been active in accessing public funds, protecting their own self-recognised values and individuals accused/victims of judicially relevant cases (up to rapes and murders), stepping on each other's toes, and accusing each other of all and any woe. Shitstorm. Since the 1994's police operation Italian Crackdown the digital rights have been dragged into this political war thanks to the (damned) political activists that have embraced and endorsed different aspects of those rights ONLY. The Autistici/Inventati digital rights association raided in 2005, has been raided again in 2010 on call of Casa Pound's founder Gianluca Jannone because the Avezzano's local branch president has been threatened with messages painted on his home. Shitstorm between (forced) minorities. The only relevant fact is the constant, historical, over-reaction of the authorities every time a computer is involved (ex: "public prosecutor in Avezzano sent international rogatory letters to the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland, where it has servers"); the constant, historical, public expenditure for this over-reaction; the constant, historical, lack of accessible public logs about this operations (ex: what is the connection between the threats received by Casa Pound in Avezzano, and the seizure of A/I servers in Norway?); the constant, historical, lack of reimbursements for the people whose rights have been judicially violated because of those operations; the constant, historical, cover-up of those not-reimbursements to preserve the idea of Athena... the Goddess of Justice. That in turn spread the fear of state mandated death orders (off side track, hidden to us). 

4. Once again today, the once called "digital rights", and the hacktivists, are the major victims of this ongoing war: "to obtain data that they had not been provided by A/I's legal representatives. A/I stresses that it did not possess the information that the Italian police sought. The Norwegian postal police visited its ISP's webfarm and copied the disks, whose contents are mostly encrypted". And our resources exhausted.

Replying to his own postulate during an interview for BBC's Psychedelic Science documentary, "What if I had not taken LSD ever; would I have still invented PCR?" He replied, "I don't know.

Some things - ex: human brain and computers - are exactly the same world wide.

Some other things instead are different.

> once the modern age push has ended even in the criminal judicial context, the on-going new political patterns and the new kind of judges that interpret not only the law, but also the scope and the values of the law, produces an incremental destructive crisis for the rule of law (it. "legalita'") and limitation of law (it. "riserva di legge") principles. It is impossible to accept these huge challenges using the existing tools. 

Those Rooty's documents, grouped with the modern arts masterpieces (Kim.Com, Assange, Manning, Snowden), the Anonymous bitcoin developers, and the well known Ethereum developers complete the millennium job. Theoretically, at least. 
Most of the findings Joanna Rutkowska had about the Intel silicons are exactly the same for all the other families of consumer silicons (AMD, ARM-based, etc) as a result of the current commercial and military policies. 
Most of the findings Joanna Rutkowska had about laptops are easily applicable to the smartphones and any other mobile device. And currently we are using those. 

Do you remember that movie, [Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/): a guy with a psychiatric relevant medical condition - I don't like the word "schizofrenia" - one day enters his boss's office, tries to extorce a better wage and his boss call the building security to kick him out, so he starts to boxe himself in his face and fall on purpose over a crystal shelf breaking it, as well as breaking his back. When the building security officers arrive, they find the employee on the floor bleeding over thousands of glass pieces. As a result his boss is jailed for assaulting one of his employee and he gets a good stack of money from insurances and alike.

We are all doing something similar every time we use a telephone: fixed, mobile, dumb, smart ... producing mass-schizofrenia (or the more popular 'paranoia'). I wonder how many people killed each other for that (ex: "he busted me!", and he hadn't).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8UerodV2n0">Luciano Pavarotti - La donna e mobile - Live 1981</iframe>

I've been on LSD once only - pitiful me - I took a third of a dose and ... I've been going around the same building of Amsterdam all the night long. Hand in hand with my two buddies. Buying an hot-dog at the corner of the building on every lap. Before yelling at the building because was not moving so I couldn't find my home. Then having any kind of fobia for not finding my home. Until, once back in the room, every time I closed my eyes the picture in my brain was a screen split in 4 sub-screens, with a caleidoscope in each, then washing the face, drinking some orange juice, and back to bed again; repeating the caleidoscope-washing-juice until I finally falled asleep. And advicing to use magic mushrooms (ie: a light psichedelic that can be stopped eating fruit sugars) instead of LSD, to all the other youngsters, in the years up to now. I didn't invent the PCR like Kary Mullis, or any other scientific miracle, but I hope you're laughing: that's the good part of sharing integral memories. Free Message Passing. And I love this memory - thanks Mr. Hofmann  - but I still don't understand why people like psychedelics. Weed is so comfortable, cheap, unharmful... sweet, and makes you sleep before you get to the idea to drive the car. Moreover I've found a much better psychedelic than LSD: the judicial systems! Once your destiny is locked in court, you start to act like a rat in some kind of experiment run by other humans. Everything in your life changes. That's why I can understand parenthood: parents buy a gun to protect their family, after I got the cops at home I've slept with a knife under my mattrass (ie: searching for weapons for the very first time of my life); parents can't sleep because the kids are crying, I couldn't sleep because my parents were crying; parents bother the governments to censor the Internet, I've bothered the government to censor the parents. And so on. Without the need of any drug. And after have provided full stack solutions: from radio signals to constitutions running on top of those signals.

I can't yet really state whether is better the 'preventive jail' the germans did, or the 'preventive psychoshit' the italians did; I tried the italian part only and no thank you, don't want to try the other one too. The only thing I'm sure of, is that they are both abuses both for the Italian Constitution and My Constitution. There will always be a frame between legit (ie: real/royal, it. "reale" for both words) and legal (ie: artificial); there will always be an [high rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tightrope_walking) to walk. Find your high rope, and walk it. I've been using the whole computer system as a reference - a balancing pole - to debug the judicial system - the wind - because science is more reliable than those fancy systems. And people, anybody et all, held it. It simply can't be the opposite. Whenever it looks like the opposite, there's a human mistake or a BOFH (like the one that keeps playing the sound card test in my laptop now).

Last but not the least, a few words to apologise for all the mistakes I might have done talking about things that I don't know enough, like the US and UK judicial systems and the people produced by those systems.

By searching for the proper translation of the italian constitutional limit to the "common law", called "riserva di legge" - ie: given the constitution is the 'ordinem', the extra ordinem sources are sources outside the constitution; so the 'riserve di legge' is what limit the chance for the people to see habits and common opinion to be law - Yahoo found the book "[On the Limits of the Law: The Ironic Legacy of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act](http://www.amazon.com/On-Limits-Law-Ironic-Legacy/dp/0801848970)"

> On the Limits of the Law is Stephen Halpern's compelling examination of the legal struggle to control the enforcement of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- the historic provision prohibiting racial discrimination in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Although the provision appeared to have immense power to fight racial inequality in education, Halpern argues, attacking the problem through legal rights and litigation distorted our understanding of educational inequality based on race and limited the remedies used to address it.

And I tought that he addressed the same issue I played around in [Antelitteram](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/29/Antelitteram.html), [NotActivist](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html), [NotPublish](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html): "attacking the problem through legal rights and litigation distorted our understanding" of the current times. Giving ([AGAIN!](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html#behavioural)) the fake idea that any behaevioural test - ex: "let's see if he can fix my TV's antenna before giving him a TV job", or "let's make my exam before giving him a PhD" - can give some kind of reliable result. Rats tested inside rat's traps. The same bullshit happens when you see a white/black guy and think he is a poor guy: why the hell you think that crap? We even invented a word for that phenomenon too: "positive racism". And there's people producing videos on the racial spectrum or whatever else: you write 'faggot' and you get the video to test you against gender discriminants. And then pushing those videos in your G+/Facebook/Whatever accounts to monitor your reaction, counting your clicks, etc. More rats testing other rats. We are far beyond that book nowadays. Far beyond the american and italian constitutions nowadays. Far beyond the "three-piece psychology and 1950’s technobrain". Where exactly I've no idea, but the same shit keep popping up from time to time: racial/gender/whatever hate, bullocks relying on psycho theories to diagnose, gov intelligencies believing in those diagnosis, miltiaries crunching&mincing whatever the intelligence said. [So we keep having and killing Jesse James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge)!

In any case that book, probably, can talk about the american common law system; better than [what I did](http://mfp19.github.io/2016/01/01/Standing.html), that's sure. And because the racial issue is one of the most ... [bloody hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_History_X) ... ones, it could be a better lecture for any willing pupil on that part of the world. Because to fix the privacy issue there's the need of a provision that "have immense power" as well, and I have no idea what the american culture can produce for that purpose; the ital-european framework I grew in evolved, privacy wise, in a somewhat different way. The only thing I could do was to find a previous real case, and point you americans to that american book.

In any case my writing is open to contributions: please send patches using git instead of talking to me by other means, and complaining that the law is smarter than that... it's a torture for me: no, it's not smarter than that, it is more expensive only. And that public expenditure - the judicial overhead over the real damage's cost - is tollerable against blood facts only; not to protect copyright, patents, and other imaginary things. Even protecting the atom-property rights (ex: the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge) where one of those modern Jessies have been killed, cost public resources and lives. The bit-properties rights cost too much. The more complex the rule is, the more expensive the law is: smarter, more expensive as a result.

[The experiment side of the story](http://mfp19.github.io/about/) is ok, there are enough self-contained references to space, time, people, and their acts, scattered all around the git repository ready to be ported into a distributed blockchained version of it; I must remove the external references (ex: YouTube videos, external Websites, etc) and embed them into the repository itself, because there's no [resilient, high available, freely accessible, universal library in place, yet](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/15/Solution.html). Technologically wise is easy (IPFS is one of the many examples), but I can't figure out how to do it (again) without stepping (again) on some of that shit typically found in the [legal labyrinth](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html#publish) that makes our lives impossible and harder than what should be: "my internet!" (Microsoft), "no, my internet!" (Google), "ok, our internet!" (Facebook), "sorry, I don't want to be your!" (Diaspora), "ok, your internet too, but money are mine only!" (Apple), "why money are yours only?" (Samsung), "because I came first!" (Apple-Samsung patents war), "and what about who comes after?", "After? What about who came before! They didn't make us trademark the word Windows and now Apple wants the words App Store?" (Microsoft) ... and so on ... and on, and on ... year after year ...

we (the people) invented the reptilians. And made fun of the people that invented reptilians: "paranoid!". And there was no need of inventing reptilians: we're not at radio age any more,

If the radio had two knobs - George Carlin's advice to the reverend - [the internet have about 2 billion channels instead](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html), and if that's not enough, there's also a way more effective capability to proactively filter out your customized idea of "shit" from your premises (only) to safeguard (more) the kids. The only thing that changed are the words to describe the

We could have invented something better than the reptilians, the phreakers, and the computer hackers nowadays! With the The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse things got better (then the UIkipedians alone!) but ... again ... do we really need to re-write everytime aaaaaaaaaall the bible-like books again before getting to the point? 

Anyway: I have no idea of the final result, shape, content, of this writing, yet. I don't know how to make it comprehensible.

Probably some tools to linearize the hypertext - an index and a chapter summary - for printing purposes are enough. I'm used to jump from one point to another one, thanks to some pre-hypertext books I was hungry for, when I was young: fantasy "game-books" where you could drive your story by jumping from one numbered chapter to another one changing your own timeline, storytelling, wave of emotions. But humans tend to loose their patience when they can't grasp a clue; for me is true in front of some mind games, for others with "harmonic texts".

We even invented the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) to grasp armonic clues, and then the discrete-time Fourier transform to account our reality by numbering the armonic clues, and then the fast Fourier transform to do it billions of times per second: nowadays it turbo-boosts the [Porn](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pr0n) delivery speed on our displays; chats and financial graphs included. It drives our planes, cars, motorbikes and go figure what else: more than the average understanding of the whole thing.

Did you get it? This page is a second iteration over all the previous ones. It's just a digest to help digestion. A re-hashing: you take the first letter, sum up with the second letter, and so on, producing 1 letter each 2 letters, from "Sah sah sah ... Test" to "Standing", to get "Epiphany". In the same way the MD5/SHA1-2-3/etc produces a fixed lenght hash to identify a bigger resource. And the whole thing presented as a collection of different data structures (index and structure) to humanly access the information repository. Repository that in turn does it at bit level instead of single letter level. It's trivial.

> Members are rapper J-Ax (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini). In the spoken intro of Strade di Città, it is stated that the band is named after the article of the Irish constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press, although it must be noted that article 31 of the Irish constitution is not about the freedom of the press. They probably meant the Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articolo_31 )

Here it is 

> During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, 1968-1994, censorship was used principally to prevent Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) interviews with spokespersons for Sinn Féin and for the IRA. 
> ... 
> In 1991, European Commission of Human Rights upheld the ban in case Purcell v. Ireland, though not unanimously. The Section 31 broadcasting ban lapsed on 19 January 1994 because it was not renewed by Minister for Arts, Culture & the Gaeltacht Michael D. Higgins, eight months prior to the August 1994 IRA ceasefire. ( [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#The_Troubles) ) 

And we have also our George Carlin too! Ladies and gentlemen, Natalino Balasso, "[a Light That Burns Twice As Bright](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/)"

Note: a quick (incomplete) translation. 

> Natalino Balasso - New Year's speech 2016
> 
> Hi all, we have left the 2015 behind our shoulders and we challenge the 2016: what are we talking about? Numbers. Some people think - wrong - that the comedians can bring people to new levels of consciusness but looking at actual results it is possible to say that consciusness is overrated: humans make love, dogs have sex. Consciusness is just a matter of lexicon. In the while time, despite our 86 billions of neurons, the dogs have sex way more than what the humans do; and Bonobos are doing way better than the dogs: the smartest race on the planet. People that fuck 12 times a day to keep society quiet and calm the nerves. We self-castrates and blame Freud for it: people don't need artists, need jesters[1] because people is not able to have fun without. The jester is nearby the power, because the jester keeps the people, like drugs keep people unconscius, and after the unconsciusness treatment the people cross the road, someone turn on the headlights on full beam and speed up. 
> 
> I know that you would like something consolatory, something like me saying that bank frauds against little savers are a shame: banks do it, we already know it, but... to give 200 grands to a bank is like play the nudist in jail! The bank frontdesk is not dangerous by itself, but if you introduce yourself to that desk using your ass ... who you want to blame then? I've never had 200 grands to invest: if I die tomorrow, my bank loose money. But having those money, I would differentiate my investments: some money on the drugs market, some on the spirits market, some on the pay-tv market, and so on. 
> 
> What I ask to you instead is: why do you want for me to talk BAD about the politicians that YOU voted for. I already have plenty problems by myself: public television don't air my comedy because there are references to sex and religion, swearings, and we are not in a spacetime worm-hole, we are not in 1964: you think I'm going to lick the balls to public television's managers? They told me to change the words of my comedy and this is the art's death. It means that what you see on TV is not written by Freemen, it is written by people that need to lick the balls! I don't change anything of my comedy, and I know that this makes someone upset because if you are a Freeman, you're existence by itself makes the slaves upset! And we are lucky because our Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had to clean up the public TV from politics: today's public television have a council so liberal that Scelba[2] looks like Gandhi. 
> 
> What do you really want for me to say in a consolatory speech? Do you want for me to say that (note: Prime Minister) Renzi promised one thing and made a different thing? Are you nut? Or you're kidding me? Do you really think that policitians can make anything without preventive authorization to the profiteering gluttons sect? The politician is like a kid on daddy's legs, truly believing to be driving the car because the steering wheel is in his hands! And we are there, fighting in the bars, eating hard to chew frozen brioches ... because of those kids! Is it the blonde kid more cute than the dark one? And I apologise to the Northern League Party guys for the word Moro[3]. I know, I have to respect your vote, in fact I respect it because I'm speaking about you and I'm serious but ... I've to admit that my asshole is laughing. Because I can't understand how you can go from "God River Po", that is blasfemy, to the nativity scene, without laughing. It is not possible! And please, stop saying on Facebook that I talk shit about the Northern League Party in order to get more Likes: do you really think that I live on Facebook's Likes? Do you know that most of the theatres are public managed by the thousands of Northern League managed town councils ... and I get my food from there! And you know how many more tell me... not only the Northern League! I'm tempted to read here the letters I receive from theatres's directors saying: "if you don't change your comedies you can't work here any more". Ongaro, director of Veneto's permanent theatre wish had never produced my comedy: his ass is burning so much that he walks always nearby some walls even without rain. Do you really thing that with all the pig-thick-skin I have in my stomach, I'm afraid of 4 words you leave to me on Facebook? Do you think I have fear of the shit you throw at me? I live in the shit. I share my house with bullfrogs. Rising the level is futile: I live down under. I fly under the radars. You cannot offend me because you can't perceive me. 
> 
> What do you want for me to say in a consolatory speech: to talk bad about someonelse's religion? We have already too many trobules because of our religion! When I was a kid the nuns told me I would have burned in hell in the case I don't exec their orders, burning of excruciating pain in the ethernal flames. Think how pitiful that life. And I'm not talking about mine! I'm talking about those poor nuns's life: at 40-50 years old they must go around with that think on their heads and make up stories for kids. About Bill Murray saying that in some countries half of the people goes around with beekeeping dresses, it worries me a lot about the consciusness level of the planet, but I don't oppose to it. I don't have the same bipolar approach: "For not being part of the blood-sucking mosquitos, we are part of the shit-eating flies". 
> 
> Or do you want for me to console you all saying that the Five Star Movement is a remotely servo-controlled device? It is true but I don't give a fuck about parties, I don't give a fucking shit of polit... even in my comedy I never talk about parties! I talk about the deamons inside us, I'm not one of those loosers pretending to be satyrs by hammering one time the iron and one time the wood of the barrel: if I could, I would rather hammer the pub owner's wife, because that poor man has always to live her alone to go having a look at the accounting made without him in place. I'm talking about ourselves, believing to be democratic, blaming others to be racist, and don't realise the racism inside us. We don't analyse it. When the taxi driver is arab I keep my hand on the door handle but I don't do it on purpose: it is pre-conditioning. When I see the Gay Pride Parade, my asshole gets smaller; I don't make it on purpose: it's just pre-conditioning. If I see a woman parking a car I think she can't do it because I don't like her; but if I like her, I ask her if she wants for me to help her parking. And I help her parking because I hope to fuck her. And maybe she is having the same fantasies. And after that we eat psycho drugs and watch tv-series because we are not Bonobos. But I never ever helped a truck driver to park! Yes we know that... probably the truck driver is probably more in need of help! 
> 
> To make it short: we are all good in watching others' stupidity, our instead have no flavour. We got used to it. We blow it every day and we wave it. Think how racist we are about intelligence: we hate dumber people, that is a stupid approach already. If you ask to a dog to bring you a protractor and it doesn't happen, do you get angry with the dog? Angry with a guy that in order to understand another guy ... needs to sniff his ass?
> 
> And another aspect is that we always must find who's guilty for something; things simply can't just happen. Let's say that your grandpa dies at 94 years, for you is not enough to accept that he was old, just ageing; no, you sue the hospital ... they might have done something wrong but ... with other's mistakes we are animals, with ours we are more permissive than Madre Teresa. In this we are backwards when compared with barbarians: if one walks reading WhatsApp and break his head on a street light, it ends up citing the town council in court because the street light should not be there. The barbarian instead would just watch around to see whether someone notice his stupidity, second he would quickly stand, and third he would ask himself how come that he has been so idiot. We can't stop being bullocks and because of this, we made up an entire art out of being bullocks. It's cool to drive a jetski, it's cool to get fat out of spirits and talk like an ape, it's cool to smoke industrial tobacco ... the most stupid thing of the world: to suck smoke, keep the toxic part only, and spit smoke. Vomiting high volume music out of the car and the club, it's so cool to have so broken ears at the point that Kingkong's farts sounds like Peter Pan's flaute. Smoking weed, to have an excuse for the bullshit we say, it's cool. We had to infiltrate the bullocks concept even in our laws: you think is normal to have a law that mandates barriers in the theatres so that you can't see the show but you can't jump down either? A bullock only would jump from the second floor of the theatre seats. I mean: the movie on stage have to be terrible! 
> 
> Think how much we are idiot whenever we chose one side; I make you an example in the soccer context because with politics we do the same thing...
