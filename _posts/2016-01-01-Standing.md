My new year's promise: if I find a safe way out from this [RAT-trap](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html), I'll push all this brainwork in a blockchain to ensure persistence as well. 

# Rationale

> Non bis in idem, which translates literally from Latin as "not twice in the same thing", is a legal doctrine to the effect that no legal action can be instituted twice for the same cause of action. It is a legal concept originating in Roman Civil Law, but it is essentially the equivalent of the double jeopardy (autrefois acquit) doctrine found in common law jurisdictions. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_bis_in_idem))

## Arts

In the [Amazing World of Italie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/) there are not working courts; no way to get persistence. This is what I've found in 2006 and [I've personally confirmed in 2010](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html#2010), and the news look awful: 

* [this paper about "The doppio binario in Italian criminal law"](http://www.law.unc.edu/documents/faculty/adversaryconference/doppiobinario-english-pelissero.pdf) seems to be Google Translated, ex: he writes "state of right", the raw translation of "stato di diritto", that in english is the "rule of law". Another problem is an ambigous existence of both the words "freedom" and "liberty" but the paper uses "freedom" only. And there's no date nor paper-ID number. But it is a good perspective written in english. 

> The aim of my report is to explain the reasons of the deep crisis of the Italian double track system, which raises problems of compatibility with constitutional rights and with the European Convention on Human Rights provisions, especially after the European Court of Human Rightsâ€™ decisions about German preventive detention (Sicherungsverwahrung) were pronounced.

> Outside these principles, the application of undetermined deprivation of freedom represents an unacceptable wound to freedom spheres and it risks to start a dangerous spiral of development of the preventive control, that deprives or reduces freedom in an abnormal dimension of "Bigbrotherisation" of criminal law and social control. 

* [the dicember 2015 strike of the criminal defendants](http://www.camerepenali.it/cat/7170/proclamata_l%E2%80%99astensione_dal_30_novembre_al_4_dicembre_2015_.html), and a few lawyers-shoot-dead preceeding the strike, is another evidence of continual failure of the judicial system. A few excerpts

> Against any extension of the "doppio binario", 41 bis and art. 146bis c.p.p., openly against the constitutional principles of fair trial 

> We took part to a debate between "accusatory" and "inquisitory" models, two cultures and two judicial procedures that fought each other in the 90s 

> From the complexity and fragmentation of this debate, emerged a new "Bigbrotherised" judicial process, completely deprived of its value, that abuses the accusatory model, in an authoritarian fashion, and allows an incremental annihilation of the defensive function

Probatory media are (made up) and distributed before the judicial procedure starts, making a public fiction before the fictio iuris itself: when the person arrives in court it is already convicted or - if for some reason can't be convicted - will suffer any kind of off-side-track retaliation (military, cops, criminals, and normal psychos, mobbers, etc). Because of this some lawyers are suffering for being worthless and being target in turn, of retaliation as well. Some others - ambulance chasers - simply abdicate their role to make their day. The courts members themselves can't do much because they make the paperwork only, relying on the law enforcement for any fact checking. The same law enforcement that imagined the story according to their [behavioural](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html#behavioural) common sense and training; or, in some cases, because of [connections between police and criminality](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html#connections). 

By introducing forced delays between facts and court trials (ex: new prevention measures cited on the "doppio binario" paper above) the law enforcement [re-dress the same person multiple times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_dei_Pupi), according to whatever happen in that "probatory period" to switch their dress between different criminal profiles, producing a 'doppler effect' on their minds and eventually induce to commit real crimes. 
Those probatory periods find legal grounds in psychological assessments contrary to the 'empirical principle' stated in the italian Constitution (art. 25), and find ex-post empirical evidence in the crimes eventually committed after the preventive hammering. 

That's why persistence ("[Guess the right courthouse and apply for a 'good character' certificate](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/28/Checklist.html)") is pretty hard to get with legacy tools. There is (was) the urgent need to adopt&adapt a new way to enforce documents [integrity and persistence](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/08/24/Integrity.html). The distributed filesystems, blockchains, etc, are those tools. 

But the judicial system itself is 100% refractory to any kind of computer-related procedural change: the lawyers union itself in that call to arms, among the other issues, states the need to oppose to reforms of the judiciary procedures where the new procedures introduce the chance for special cases to use videoconferencing tools. And the same kind of resistance from the judicial system stakeholders (judges, prosecutors, attorneys) popped up any time a computer-aided procedure has been attempted. 

And of course, [unconstitutional RATs](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html#rats) ensure the grounds for the impossibility to rely on computer-aided fair trials. 

## Tech

Git uses an SHA-1 ([fragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity)) hashing system that ensures accidental corruption only. And GitHub is cloud-only distributed, not public trust enforced. It means that in a world of (labour) scarcity, I'm not ensured "[against well-funded opponents](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/10/sha-1_freestart.html)" and [BOFH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell). 

Best practice reference: BitCoin uses an SHA-2 system, recursively blockchained using a real-time mass-produced random seed; pretty hardcore stuff. And for military grade persistence is possible to oversize the financial SHA-2, using SHA-3 ... lovely. 

## Hard core euristics

The attorneys union states also: 

> the right to be heard within a reasonable time and the presumption of innocence risk to be deleted [...] also by the break-in of the international courts, where is possible to note the friction between the continental law proper of the italian system and the common law governing the european jurisdiction.

**That is partly true** but it should be welcomed as a [positive innovation](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html#constitution), given that the italian previous art ("cases") would be used for the future evolutions of the new born common law system; to grant cultural continuity. 

**And it is partly false** as well: a common belief among the english is the european law to be the continental law. Who's wrong? COM'ON BRITTONS, LET'S BLAME THE GERMANS! Ok, just kidding ... 

None. None is wrong. 

To understand there's the need to remember two things: the Magna Carta, and the artificial nature of the italian constitution and its republic. The Magna Carta was 

> First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel barons (Wikipedia)

and stated a bunch of rights (due process, habeas corpus, etc) that the king would grant to those barons, calling them Freemen (because of their properties, their slaves, and their army). Since the 13th century, the things evolved in a very natural way in UK (ie: never conquered, never conquerors; just messing around from time to time and [re-confirming the Magna Carta just after every hard time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Laws_of_England)) extending those rights to more and more people until they became universal rights: even to scotts and redheads. (Grin). Even today some of those ancient formulas are in use in royal ceremonies and judicial proceedings: "who's standing?". And they jealously preserve this feeling of being individuals - Freeman - even if today most of them have no property and no army, and probably have to go down to the blood for the military service only. 

The italian constitution instead was loosely derived from the Statuto Albertino - the previous royal statute - under the allies supervision, in an emergency condition where it was impossible to think at being freemen: after a war that have been lost, after the king left the country, after [almost 100 years of repression of the republic idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini), and so on. Today's italians are not born as Freemen, but as equal men with defined rights (first part of the constitution) inside only the constitutional framework. The Constitution - after the basic rights of every man - assert the existance of family ("atom of society") and religion ("to make peace with the Pope after Rome has been annexed to the Kingdom of Italy"), then defines in detail every institution composing that framework. This is artificial, very likely the german one: both countries has been rebuilt recently. But germans don't have special police with public officer status, holding guns and manipulating the private communications: just preventive monitoring. They did it properly; maybe not perfect - even the germans mess around sometimes - but fair. 

**The british kings had to make peace with their people granting them rights, the italie-crats had to lick the balls to the pope on french, spanish and swiss requests. That's why every time italians fail, to write our constitution we need a tyrolean.**

This difference indeed became smaller in time, by increasing the amount of cases that finely shaped the common law, and by increasing the number of laws that heavily bloated the civil law. Often because of the sign of international treaties that were perceived internally as "international law", "continental law", "european law"; on both sides. **Foreign crap shitting on our law**. In all this, germans are at most ... victims, because of being at the very heart of the european continent; geographically, only. 

It can be seen today in the way the so called 'rights' are perceived, in the nature of the two passports, in the commercial law (ex: Italy used to have the Societa' Anonima, like most of the spanish speaking countries today), and in the Anonymous movement: in UK is not possible to be anonymous, you can be a Freeman (with your name, face, heart, balls and ass) and stand in front of the courts granted to you, or be transported to Botany Bay; and this standing brings to new cases that shape the law and trigger parliamentary discussions toward new acts. 

**The UK system evolved naturally to be artificial. Italian system is artificially created to be natural.**

In Italy there's nothing to stand for, because the rights pre-exist the people, and are recognised ex-post by the constitution (art. 2), and named one by one; the parliament give the new law to the President of the Republic for checks against the constitution, the courts signal factual abuses to the constitutional court, the constitutional court abrogates them. In all this the individual doesn't exist. The rights are already there: why are you standing for, you idiot? 

Other Freemen I don't know. [Personally I'm not standing](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html#hacktivist). I spend must of my day sitting on my ass writing this stuff or studying something. Coping with the compulsory immigration rules of the place I'm living in. At the beginning I was waiting - the italian judicial times: years, not days - for my lawyer to make me talk in court; when he quit ... just living, searching for another way to fix that crap. 

So yes: **I'm standing**. In a modern way: sitting, and not to the blood. Even if I couldn't find a court for standing. But I guess **I can stand both in a UK court and in an italian one: being judged two times for the same fact**. It would be fun. 

Politics apart: in the UK system it would result in a new acquittal case because of the empirical evidence, in the italian one in a constitutional exception that would partly abrogate a law. My problem is that the italian judicial is deeply broken; and I can't bother the english judicial. 

I searched for international courts in order to have UK-like common law procedures, using the italian previous cases to fill in those procedures. In vain. 

Standing.
