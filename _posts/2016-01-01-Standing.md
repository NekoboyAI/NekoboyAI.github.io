My new year's promise: if I find a safe way out from this [RAT-trap](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html), I'll push all this brainwork in a blockchain to ensure persistence as well. 

# <a name="rationale"></a>Rationale

> Non bis in idem, which translates literally from Latin as "not twice in the same thing", is a legal doctrine to the effect that no legal action can be instituted twice for the same cause of action. It is a legal concept originating in Roman Civil Law, but it is essentially the equivalent of the double jeopardy (autrefois acquit) doctrine found in common law jurisdictions. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_bis_in_idem))

In the [Amazing World of Italie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/) there are not working courts; no way to get persistence. This is what I've found in 2006 and [I've personally confirmed in 2010](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html#2010), and the news look awful: 

* [this paper about "The doppio binario in Italian criminal law"](http://www.law.unc.edu/documents/faculty/adversaryconference/doppiobinario-english-pelissero.pdf) seems to be Google Translated, ex: he writes "state of right", the raw translation of "stato di diritto", that in english is the "rule of law". Another problem is an ambigous existence of both the words "freedom" and "liberty" but the paper uses "freedom" only. And there's no date nor paper-ID number. But it is a good perspective written in english. 

> The aim of my report is to explain the reasons of the deep crisis of the Italian double track system, which raises problems of compatibility with constitutional rights and with the European Convention on Human Rights provisions, especially after the European Court of Human Rightsâ€™ decisions about German preventive detention (Sicherungsverwahrung) were pronounced.

> Outside these principles, the application of undetermined deprivation of freedom represents an unacceptable wound to freedom spheres and it risks to start a dangerous spiral of development of the preventive control, that deprives or reduces freedom in an abnormal dimension of "Bigbrotherisation" of criminal law and social control. 

* [the dicember 2015 strike of the criminal defendants](http://www.camerepenali.it/cat/7170/proclamata_l%E2%80%99astensione_dal_30_novembre_al_4_dicembre_2015_.html), and a few lawyers-shoot-dead preceeding the strike, is another evidence of continual failure of the judicial system. A few excerpts

> Against any extension of the "doppio binario", 41 bis and art. 146bis c.p.p., openly against the constitutional principles of fair trial 

> We took part to a debate between "accusatory" and "inquisitory" models, two cultures and two judicial procedures that fought each other in the 90s 

> From the complexity and fragmentation of this debate, emerged a new "Bigbrotherised" judicial process, completely deprived of its value, that abuses the accusatory model, in an authoritarian fashion, and allows an incremental annihilation of the defensive function

Probatory media are (made up) and distributed before the judicial procedure starts, making a public fiction before the fictio iuris itself: when the person arrives in court it is already convicted or - if for some reason can't be convicted - will suffer any kind of off-side-track retaliation (military, cops, criminals, and normal psychos, mobbers, etc). Because of this some lawyers are suffering for being worthless and being target in turn, of retaliation as well. Some others - ambulance chasers - simply abdicate their role to make their day. The courts members themselves can't do much because they make the paperwork only, relying on the law enforcement for any fact checking. The same law enforcement that imagined the story according to their [behavioural common sense and training](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html#behavioural); or, in some cases, because of [connections between police and criminality](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html#connections). 

By introducing forced delays between facts and court trials (ex: new prevention measures cited on the "doppio binario" paper above) the law enforcement [re-dress the same person multiple times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_dei_Pupi), according to whatever happen in that "probatory period" to switch their dress between different criminal profiles, producing a 'doppler effect' on their minds and eventually induce to commit real crimes. 
Those probatory periods find legal grounds in psychological assessments contrary to the 'empirical principle' stated in the italian Constitution (art. 25), and find ex-post empirical evidence in the crimes eventually committed after the preventive hammering. 

That's why persistence ("[Guess the right courthouse and apply for a 'good character' certificate](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/28/Checklist.html)") is pretty hard to get with legacy tools. There is (was) the urgent need to adopt&adapt a new way to enforce documents [integrity and persistence](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/08/24/Integrity.html). The distributed filesystems, blockchains, etc, are those tools. 

But the judicial system itself is 100% refractory to any kind of computer-related procedural change: the lawyers union itself in that call to arms, among the other issues, states the need to oppose to reforms of the judiciary procedures where the new procedures introduce the chance for special cases to use videoconferencing tools. And the same kind of resistance from the judicial system stakeholders (judges, prosecutors, attorneys) popped up any time a computer-aided procedure has been attempted. 

And of course, [unconstitutional RATs](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html#rats) ensure the grounds for the impossibility to rely on computer-aided fair trials: judges may end up reading false documents because the law enforcement itself served those at a later stage, to bypass the courts and persecute the individual according to their first surveys.

Git uses an SHA-1 ([fragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity)) hashing system that ensures accidental corruption only. And GitHub is cloud-only distributed, not public trust enforced. It means that in a world of (labour) scarcity, I'm not ensured "[against well-funded opponents](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/10/sha-1_freestart.html)" and [BOFH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell). 

Best practice reference: BitCoin uses an SHA-2 system, recursively blockchained using a real-time mass-produced random seed; pretty hardcore stuff. And for military grade persistence is possible to oversize the financial SHA-2, using SHA-3 ... lovely.

The attorneys union states also: 

> the right to be heard within a reasonable time and the presumption of innocence risk to be deleted [...] also by the break-in of the international courts, where is possible to note the friction between the continental law proper of the italian system and the common law governing the european jurisdiction.

**That is partly true** but it should be welcomed as a [positive innovation](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html#constitution), given that the italian previous art ("cases") would be used for the future evolutions of the new born common law system; to grant cultural continuity. 

**And it is partly false** as well: a common belief among the english is the european law to be the continental law. Who's wrong? COM'ON BRITTONS, LET'S BLAME THE GERMANS! Ok, just kidding ... 

None. None is wrong. 

To understand there's the need to remember two things: the Magna Carta, and the artificial nature of the italian constitution and its republic. The Magna Carta was 

> First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel barons (Wikipedia)

and stated a bunch of rights (due process, habeas corpus, etc) that the king would grant to those barons, calling them Freemen (because of their properties, their slaves, and their army). At the time the process didn't exist and the gallows were privileges for few lucky bastards. Since the 13th century, the things evolved in a very natural way in UK (ie: never conquered, never conquerors; just messing around from time to time and [re-confirming the Magna Carta just after every hard time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Laws_of_England)) extending those rights to more and more people until they became universal rights. Even today some of those ancient formulas are in use in royal ceremonies and judicial proceedings: "who's standing?". And they jealously preserve this feeling of being individuals - Freeman - even if today most of them have no property and no army, live on rents, and probably have to go down to the blood for the military service only. In the same way of the rest of EU and north America. 

The italian constitution instead was loosely derived from the Statuto Albertino - the previous royal statute - under the Allies supervision, in an emergency condition where it was impossible to think at being freemen: after a war that have been lost, after the king left the country, after [almost 100 years of repression of the republic idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini), and so on. Today's italians were not born as Freemen, but as equal men with defined rights (first part of the constitution) inside only the constitutional framework. The Constitution - after the basic rights of all the citizens, not every individual - assert the existance of family ("atom of society") and religion ("to make peace with the Pope after Rome has been annexed to the Kingdom of Italy"), then defines in detail every institution composing that framework; and the way to change it. This is artificial, very likely the german one: both countries has been rebuilt recently. But germans don't have special police with public officer status, holding guns and manipulating the private communications: just preventive monitoring. They did it properly; maybe not perfect but fair. 

**The british kings had to make peace with their people granting them rights, the italie-crats had to lick the balls to the pope on french, spanish and swiss requests. That's why the italian constitution was written by a tyrolean.**

This difference indeed became smaller in time, by increasing the amount of cases that finely shaped the common law, and by increasing the number of laws that heavily bloated the civil law. Often because of the sign of international treaties that were perceived internally as "international law", "continental law", "european law"; on both sides. **Foreign crap shitting on our law**. In all this, germans are at most ... victims, because of being at the very heart of the european continent; geographically, only. Indeed, whatever it is not bottom-up, it is international law. Not continental. 

This difference can be seen today in the way the so called 'rights' are perceived, in the nature of the two passports, in the commercial law (ex: Italy used to have the Societa' Anonima, like most of the spanish speaking countries today), and in the Anonymous movement: in UK is not possible to be anonymous, you can be a Freeman (with your name, face, heart, balls and ass) and stand in front of the courts granted to you, or be transported to Botany Bay; and this standing brings to new cases that shape the law and eventually trigger parliamentary discussions toward new acts. 

In Italy there's nothing to stand for, because the rights pre-exist the people, are recognised ex-post by the constitution (art. 2), and named one by one; the parliament give the new law to the President of the Republic for checks against the constitution, the courts signal factual abuses to the constitutional court, the constitutional court abrogates them. In all this the individual doesn't exist: there's no Freeman, there's an idea of citizen built buy composing rights at judicial time. The rights are already there: why are you standing for, you idiot? I'm standing because those rights are not enforced; our parliaments, and law enforcement, enforced the compression of rights. And annihilation of rights. 

**The UK system evolved naturally to be artificial. Italian system is artificially created to be natural.**

And this generates a bit of confusion. 

## <a name="example"></a>An example: art. 612 bis of the criminal code, aka "stalking law".

There's a tiny little truth in the complaint by the italian lawyers ([against what they perceive as being "common law"](#euristics)): some of the european directives, european parliament rulings, and young law advisors studing abroad, introduced overlapping disciplines in the italian criminal code; fragmenting the historical debate between accusatory and inquisitory systems. And producing damages, an overall turmoil; probably deadly. 

> confusion of the defense of the accused, with the defense of the crime definition itself, creating inadmissible discrimination 

Example: "stalking". In the italian criminal code there was an entire chapter called "persecutory acts", grouping a bunch of well defined crimes: one act defined, one mandatory minimum and maximum; each act a crime. Those actions pre-defined in crimes, are the atoms of the stalking beheaviour emerging from the sum of all the previous sentences in the common law systems. The common law system let it be open to further evolutions; when a detail of a new stalking episode makes sense, there's a new sentence, a new case study is written in the university books, and some previous cases might be reviewed. The civil law system doesn't: it checks facts against the pre-defined crimes book. In both systems the beheavioural training of the law enforcement plays a major role in producing false positives; that's why the italian constitution mandates an overall bound to empirism (art. 25 - "... committed fact."); that in turn creates some problems in punishing administrative (ex: contracts) and beheavioural (ex: "passion crimes") descriptions of facts. Basically the constitution denies jail (torture, and death) for any "pure information crime", unless an oath (or stronger promises) has been made before (ex: military). 

Then both systems proceed to computing the right penalty. 

By introducing a new article (612bis) in the codes there's an overlap between that single article and the entire chapter it has been inserted in; this creates problems at the moment of computing the penalty because the italian system gets the proved crime with the higher penalty (ie: the most offensive one), sum the others (proved, if any), sum the repeated ones (if any) up to 6 times, then adjusts the resulting sum to reality according to overal righterous punishment principles - the entire algoritm is complex, arguable and subjected both to changes and to the individual judge arbitration - but the overlapping article (612bis) include all those articles in the same chapter ("persecutory crimes"), summing up multiple penalties for the same act: again a double-track ("doppio binario") problem, this time at penalty kick time. And because it is not an evolutionary system like the common law, new details and mistakes, are not immediately taken into consideration, expecially if the defenders are not taken into consideration: it produces a ton of false positives (innocents in jail) and false negatives (guilties set free). 

And there's no way to explain this to law practitioners. They are all malformed, in the same way, at university times: they tend to ignore reality ([protocols](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html#publish)), confusing the reality with the fictio iuris they produce in court: the process is a slow motion fiction of reality, only. A good fiction, but not reality. 

Moreover the static definition of the crime typical of the civil law, produces those judicial mistakes for prolonged periods of time: it can take years before the parliament goes back to the same topic or one judge raise a constitutional exception. 
In the case of the new ([behavioural](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/26/Profile.html#behavioural)) stalking discipline, between 2009 and 2014 

* about 30% of the people abused for investigation purposes - the "misure cautelari" ("prevention measures") described in the ["doppio binario" paper](#art) - were not even set to court after the preliminary investigation: no "fumus commissi delicti". There was not steak, nor the smoke of it. Just the paranoia to be stalked or the open will to abuse of the law enforcement and the judicial system to torture someone. 
* about 60% of the remaining cases were set to court resulted in acquittals. 
* the 10% of proved stalkers, showed the failure of the policy change, for facts that were already effectively managed by the law enforcement trough unformal warnings and formal restriction orders. The old grandma recepe is there for a reason. 
* the stalking law - that superseeded the old grandma recepe of unformal warnings and formal retriction orders - didn't save women from getting killed (because of the restriction orders): [women themselves assert no murders reduction](https://www.change.org/p/la-legge-612-bis-stalking-non-tutela-le-donne). 
* the stalking law was restricted, by definition, to the cases of pre-existing love affairs (fuck friends, engaged, married): what about the investigative journalists? Private detectives? Hackers in march? We, hackers, knew we couldn't make anything for it since 2009: my lawyer&girlfriend - that in 2010 sued me - explained in detail the crap behind the law; another lawyer explained to us all the fictio iuris behind this new bunch of laws (ie: purely information based, no empirism; they all give for granted that the person trust a monitor or the integrity of a paper document). In 2014 the stalking law has been modified to include any case of stalking (not the "love affairs" only), moving the "love affairs" (fuck friends, engaged, married) clausole from a condition to proof guilty, to an increase of the penalty in the case of being proven guilty. That, in turn, limit the chances of journalists, detectives, whistleblowers, solos, to investigate (ex: "why my roof is dipping? Let's have a look at my neighbours' habits"); a modern Newton could get arrested because the tree was in the neighbors's garden and the neighbor's wife felt observed when she lay naked close to the swimming pool. 

At that point, dirty deeds have been made to avoid a waterfall of new trials for reimbursments: the whole stalking discipline was introduced to save on judicial costs, the open fail (and its reimbursment) would invalidate this effort and openly show the failure of that policy, and the failure of the people that signed it, that have already spent the public fundings of their (criminal) activities. It happened for immigration and drugs laws as well. And for similar, political, reasons something similar could happen in any common law Freeman standing. 

> confusion of the defense of the accused, with the defense of the crime definition itself 

is created on purpose by MPs defending their parliamentary acts, and the way they allocated the public resources. There are plenty examples on YouTube, and some of those videos have been pushed under our - activists&hacktivists - eyes only, [relying on the tracking capabilities of the tools in use by the police forces](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/30/NotActivist.html#connections), and their killing hands for punishments. 

## <a name="do"></a>Do

Other Freemen I don't know. [Personally I'm not standing because the law was malformed, the law enforcement not enough brave to discuss it, and the court didn't deserve its role](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/17/Constitution.html#hacktivist). I spend must of my day sitting on my ass writing this stuff or studying some IT stuff. Coping with the compulsory immigration rules of the place I'm living in. At the beginning I was waiting - the italian judicial times: years, not days - for my lawyer to make me talk in court - because I didn't want to reveal the trick before using a telecommunication tool - when he quit ... just living, searching for another way to clean up that crap, get my reimboursement, and leave that shithole for ever. 

I've started from not being taken into consideration by the court that judged me instead of judging the parties in the room, only. That triggered My Constitution. I gave them a second chance in 2010. That triggered My Law. Next time an italian institution will have a chance it will be to defend itself from me. 

So yes: **I'm standing**. In a modern way: sitting because I couldn't find a court for standing; and not to the blood because I'm not a military. I searched for international courts in order to have UK-like common law procedures, using the italian previous cases to fill in those procedures: the thing that those lawyers are complaining of. And I searched in vain. But I guess **I can stand both in a UK court and in an italian one: being judged two times for the same fact.** [It would be fun to challenge both the Lords of the Law, using a time-division atomic principle.](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/20/Timeless.html). 

It isn't fun because they - law practitioners - don't take into consideration the sub-artistic reasoning. [Protocols](http://mfp19.github.io/2015/12/31/NotPublish.html#publish). Example: a telephone call is built on top of two legs, caller and called, one initiates, one receives. Any caller can be barred, filtered out, both network side and called side; the stalker can be filtered out without even telling him. And without the need of data retention policies to judicially assert the facts ex-post. Easy, smooth. But if politics don't want for courts to go there, they won't take this obvious empirical fact into consideration. And it is worse than that: if the offender caller set himself anonymous, they would start to mangle the issue from the legal perspective... 

Politics apart: in the UK system my case would result in a new acquittal case because of the empirical evidence - and I might even be mentioned on a book again; last time was about IT, this time would about judicial, ain't fun but it's ok - in the italian one in a constitutional exception that would partly abrogate a law. My problem is that the italian judicial is deeply broken; and I can't bother the english judicial. Otherwise it would be fun. 

Someone says "Biting the pillow", i prefer "Keep Standing". 

Non bis in idem.
