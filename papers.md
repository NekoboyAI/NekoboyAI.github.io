TODO: The plan is to add here links to select papers and projects I have worked
on in the past 10+ years (ala CV or ego-boosting kind of thing). The papers and
code themselves should probably live in another repo to keep the blog repo
reasonably small for those who would like to clone it in order to e.g. verify
the tags.
