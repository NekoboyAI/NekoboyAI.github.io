I don't have a list of select papers and projects I have authored (or co-authored)
over the past ~20 years, sorted by topic, and in inverse chronoloigical order.
The reason is that I've never been involved in any relevant project.
I made my things for personal, intimate, fun, and/or for money: 
when it is fun, docs are useless (because it is the boring part); 
when it is work, docs are useless (because nobody is willing to pay for that).

When I was at high school I red that all the science
is evolved by the 1% of the people that knows about it, and because of 
the huge effort needed for serious research, they have no time
to decently document their works.
Another 25% can understand those works, and spend their time to document it.
Another 70% can understand second tier docs, and take advantage of 
those documents to actually do something useful.

The remaining 104% of people talking about science, sometimes destroys 
sometimes incentivate science.

[I'm in that 4% that knows a bit of it, and try to explain it to anyone](http://punto-informatico.it/cerca.aspx?s=michele+favara+pedarsi&t=4).
