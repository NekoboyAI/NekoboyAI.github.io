I don't have a list of select papers and projects I have authored (or co-authored)
over the past ~20 years, sorted by topic, and in inverse chronoloigical order.

The reason is that when I was at high school I red that all the science
is evolved by the 1% of the people that knows about it, and they have no time
to decently document their works.
Another 25% can understand those works and spend their time to write documents.
Another 70% take advantage of those documents to actually do something useful.
The remaining 104% destroys science.
