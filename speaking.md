This page (hopefully) contains some useful information for conference organizers
who wish to invite me to speak at their event, such as the current biography &
photo to be used for the conference page, as well as a few technical
requirements/constrains for travel and food.

Travel requirements
--------------------

1. You pay (from my seat inside my house, to the average middle class
   vehicle in the place of arrival).

2. A/R tickets only.


Dietary constrains
-------------------

1. Overal Rule: I eat everything that is clean and doesn't make me sick.

2. Animals: I didn't enjoy grasshoppers and larvae, rats, cats and dogs.
   I hated to eat animals bigger than a cow.
   I hated to shoot a wild animal for food.
   I have no problems to kill home grown chickens, turkeys, etc, and
   turn them into a good soup or BBQ.

3. Flavours: I'm curious about strong flavours but I can't eat a full meal of those.
   I love wasabi.

4. Comfort: I need western food. After a few days without, I become a zombie.


Other constrains
-----------------

1. As a matter of principle, I shouldn't travel to countries whose official laws are
   in stark contrast with my personal believes and values. This includes e.g.
   all the countries that infringe constitutional rights I was born with,
   but in practice I care only about not being personally subject to any risk by local laws.


Tips & Tricks
--------------

1. Please don't ask me "how did you start with computers and security": it has
   always been a part of my life. The other kids on the beach were making sand
   castels, I was explainind sandboxing to the life guard under his umbrella.
   Then it became a job. Then I made 15 exams at uni, because couldn't proceed further
   without solid math and physics principles.
   BTW, no kidding here: I can make you laugh about it. My story is all upside down.

2. Please don't ask me how do I like the place I'm just visiting: I've been enjoing
   any luxury and shithole I found myself in, because of my perverse tendancy to
   appreciate every little good thing I can find in any context.
   And complain about all the rest of it. A warning about local taboos would be
   appreciated, because I've the perverse tendancy to notice and talk about
   any weird thing I see, and laugh about it; and sometimes it causes death.

3. Don't ask me to help with your laptop, career or to give my fish to you.
   The only thing I'm willing to do is to teach you how to fish some.

4. Don't abduct me somewhere: it already happened and this caused to me to be scared
   to move from my actual geographic position unless I have some well known host,
   or a good amount of peanuts/money, on arrival.

5. My name is pronounced as you wish to pronounce it but ... I don't guarrantee
   that I will turn to you if I can't recognise the sound of my name.

Thanks for your understanding!
