Welcome to my n-test for a decentralization-friendly,
liberated, and integrity-protected blog and website!
Waiting for a decentralized Internet to come back,
it is worth to give a try to a git-based gpg-signed
content repo.


About Me
=========

My name is mfp, I lead my feet and a limited amount of air over my head
(see [about.md](/about.md) and [contact.md](/contact.md) for more info).
As soon as I can get a safe terminal to access the net I'll be in charge
of my words again too.


About this Website/Blog/Repo
============================

I've never had a blog before. I hate blogs. To expose what we already
do everyday, in every and each human context, since the first monkey
learned how to talk, is ... wasteful. A potential of 8 billion times
redundant bullshit. A huge amount of disgusting smelly hot shit.
<br>
In other words: to turn the human chatting into a show is 
a dangerous and insignificant waste of energy until we don't get
rules that guarrantee no actions can be taken upon someone that had a speech.
Any speech. About anything. And it looks like we are loosing that war :)
<br>
To be clear: if YOU point YOUR terminal (computer, phone or washing machine)
to access the bullshit that is supposed to be mine ... don't complain then 
because YOU don't like it. A solo job is a ... wanker.
<br>
To be completely honest with you all: we didn't finish yet to discuss with big
weaponized guys commonly called 'green berrets', 'marines', 'MiBs', etc ...
people that ... me, you, and anybody, don't really want to discuss with.
They are not happy for the kids to keep the cryptotoys to digitally sign our graffiti.
And you get upset with ... well ... whatever you see on your monitor? 
Are you stupid or ... what? Don't get me wrong: I'm an idiot. But I know it. 
What about you?
So, stop believing to icons and pictures, texts and whatever ... 
and don't go around yelling (or worse) against pedoterrosatanists.
There's the need to fix the message integrity issue first; that is
the only reason for me to play with this words you're reading.
<br>
To tell you the whole truth I had some sort of blog a bit before Google popped up (2001):
the reason was that I had need to practice some advanced Perl programming
so I packed togeter an opinion-spitting tool.
And after 6 months was down again: do the world really needs my opinions? No.


Content of this repo
---------------------

* My experiments.
* [Contact info](/contact.md) and my [GPG keys](/keys.md)
* Other info about myself and my work


(WiP) Distribution and hosting
------------------------------

This blog/website is distributed as a git-repo, and is primarily hosted on my
GitHub account. You should be able to clone it using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/mfp19/mfp19.github.io

You can also view the sources at GitHub online
[here](https://github.com/mfp19/mfp19.github.io).

As soon as I can figure out how to decentralise the whole thing, alternative URLs might be added.

One can get notifications about new posts/updates via:

* The blog's [RSS feed](/feed.xml)
* [My GitHub Account] (https://github.com/mfp19/)


(WiP) Integrity protection
--------------------------

This blog/repo is integrity protected using [git
tags](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html) digitially
signed with [my blog-signing key](/keys/). In order to verify the
authenticity of all or any of the posts, you can use the following command:

    $ git describe --exact-match HEAD
    <some tag>
    $ git tag -v <some tag>


(WiP) (In)dependency on GitHub
------------------------------

While this repo is hosted on GitHub, and some GitHub-specific features are
exploited in order to make this more available to a wider audience,
specifically GitHub's support for [Static Web
Hosting](https://pages.github.com/), it should be stressed that neither
availability nor integrity of this blog requires one to use or trust GitHub.

If, for some reason, GitHub, or an ISP, or whoever in between, decided to
block, falsify, or censor this blog, there are dozens of alternative ways of
how this repo (blog) could be delivered, e.g. via Tor or other transports, and
thanks to using git signed tags, its integrity could be always verified.
Well, at least this is the issue I'm addressing here.

Technologically speaking we made everything possible, and its opposite,
to make it happen. But there are huge regulatorry issues, a legal framework
that entangles the beauty of the electron into dirty crap supposed to be
for our own good. Some of the security features or some of the business rules,
must be dropped, trashed, quickly, for the real security to be.
And it's not happening mainly because of bigger issues raised in the while:
economy downturns, entire countries exploding, wars, lone wolves. Geopolitics.
Big guys playing with steel&fire ... again.

So, the real challenge is to be able to keep message integrity on a rogue
communication channel. Get yourself an old fashioned walkie-talkie,
consider that anybody could be listening, and start speaking about your personal
things on-air: size of your dick&boobs, who you love and what you hate, your ID number,
the pin code of your credit card, etc.
The Internet is the same but instead of having a 1-km radius only, it's world wide.

You will probably figure out soon that the best way to stay low and safe,
is to be anonymous:

* to obfuscate the TCP/IP process of selecting best paths in a network; ie: to use Tor.
* to obfuscate your identity; ie: avoid registries, accounts for silly toys, and so on.

But again: current policies are made to enforce accountability of everything that goes
from kids parenthood to insurances backtracking. Not to enforce anonimity.
Basically in some jurisdictions if you use Tor, you get monitored, by design; because
the war on drugs and the rest of the witch hunts. Some Tor nodes run by gov agencies
themselves, not by volunteers.

Volunteers that have bootstrapped those tools have already been greylisted.
Companies that tried to resist search orders got fined and individuals running those
businesses clamped and locked. The end result is that today we are unable
to support our own safety.

Unhappy ending: theoretically "there are dozens of alternative ways of 
how this repo (blog) could be delivered". In practice, considering the UN/NATO polcies 
of the past 15 years, there aren't. Not... for everyone (cfr. RFC3271).
